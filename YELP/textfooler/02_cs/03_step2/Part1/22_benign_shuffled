Awesome food. First time here so I can't guarantee all the items, but what I tried makes me think the menu is promising. Wow. Yum. And they have a daily special that's happy hour prices. Not to mention the awesome chips and dip (mild, hot hot, and spicy bean dip) that come out as soon as u sit. Yum!
I walk on a Sat morning at 11am for a retouch on my ombre hair. I had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait I did. She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasn't going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short after3hrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me there(for another 30-45mins). I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with 2 other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yellow/orange/black and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after 6+hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didn't like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on 16th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on 15th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nice/caring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about 2hrs or less. I really recomment Lorraine at the Camelback location. She also didn't charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair.
A few of us hit Smoky Jon's for lunch today.  It was insisted that it's the best BBQ in Madison, so I was game to try it.  The place has character - you order at a window and go take a seat.  They bring the food out to you.  Nothing fancy - paper plates, styrofoam cups, etc.  I got a chopped smoked pork sandwich with coleslaw and french fries.  I snarfed a fry to start.  Not very hot... “warm”, I'd say. But tasty - salty.  Could have been better if fresh, but they'll do.  The coleslaw was the creamiest I've ever had.  The flavor wasn't strong, but it was okay.  Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought “yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it”.  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, “you know, that was REALLY good!”  While it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!  My coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!  Tip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)
I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons, so I finally got a chance to check this place out.  I'm usually not big on chain bagels, but I'm not going to turn down a free meal either.  I tried to go once before but they close at 5pm on Sundays.  The sign on the door is lightly confusing since it used to read 6 but the bottom left-hand corner of the 6 was obfuscated in order to make it appear as though it was a 5.   I finally made it last week and had a whole wheat bagel with jalapeno cream cheese.  The bagel was on par with the standard bagel you can get out of a bag at the supermarket.  The jalapeno cheese was delicious and the highpoint of the meal. The people working there were friendly and accommodating.  The main hangup was that the worker didn't offer to toast my bagel and, me thinking this would be standard didn't ask, left me with a pretty difficult to eat bagel.  After I took one bite I really needed my water to wash down the dense bagel.  In NYC you could probably eat untoasted bagels since they are really light and fluffy, but this one was a bit tough to swallow.  I feel a conflict of interest when giving them only 2 stars since my bagel was free, but it'll have to remain at 2 until I get my next bagel (also gratis) before the coupon expires.
When I was younger, my aunt and uncle and cousins lived in Kenosha, WI.  We would drive up a few times a year to visit them, and after 2 hours of peering out the car windows along 94, my brother and cousins and I would be dying to get out of the car at any of the attractions along the way--Six Flags, the outlet malls, or any of the many cheese shops that announced your arrival to Wisconsin.    When I went skiing with friends at Cascade Mountain last winter, years of unfulfilled longing swept over me and I demanded that we stop at one.  The one we selected was the Mousehouse Cheesehaus, chosen mostly for it's cute sign and awesome name.  Being a lover of all things dairy walking in, I beelined for the cheese counter, demanding samples of anything and everything.  Oh my!  Anything from a basic, kid friendly American to a 15 year aged Cheddar, to their own special haus cheese.  I probably walked out with a good 2 lbs of various cheeses (and am still wondering how those seemed to add 10 lbs to my figure, but that's another story).  In addition, there were the usual Wisconsin knick knacks, including many types of beers, wines, and other kitsch-y stuff like ashtrays and bottle openers.  The woman working at the counter didn't seem too charmed by my friends and I, but I'm sure I would tire of travelers demanding cheese nibbles after a while, myself.
In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.  If I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control.
I cant believe I have been here for going on seven years and just tried this restaurant.  The sauce is AMAZING and the meat is tender and delicious.  The atmosphere isnt the greatest, even for a BBQ joint, but the food was great.
Worst experience with a hairdresser ever, at this location. Made an appointment with Diane for a body wave. When I was sort of greeted by her she looked at my hair and said “You get body waves?” Yeah, that's why I booked one at your salon. Then she argued with me about when to trim, I wanted after she wanted before, and after five minutes acknowledged that it didn't matter, but FIRST telling me the perm “wouldn't soak in” on the ends unless she trimmed it. Then she argued with me about the rods. It's taken me over ten years to figure out with Aveda perm hairstylists what the perfect combo is. Diane knew better, but finally agreed. Then she proceeded to comb my wet hair, from the forehead back, scratching my scalp and jerking my head. That wasn't enough, though. She then started rolling it with the rods she thought I should have.  I got up and left. When I addressed the problem at the front, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO HELP me other than to offer coming back and talking to the owner. Yeah. Right. THAT'S gonna happen. Horrible salon...dirty, also, just as a side note.
Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately, the second visit wasn't any better.  I will start with the good. Service is pretty good.  The place smells of smoke. Why? Because you can smoke in the bar and there is an opening from the bar into the restaurant. This has to be a violation of the no smoking in dining areas in Pittsburgh. Gross.   The floor (carpeted) is so old that it is sticky and worn down. Walking on it with shoes on disgusted me. The walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place. Please, remodel! At least make me feel like the place is clean. If I feel like it is dirty in the dining hall, I can't imagine it's clean in the kitchen.  Now for the food. I am pretty picky about seafood. It needs to be fresh and cooked correctly. Don't get the Salmon or Tuna Steak. Tuna and Salmon should be easy to get right if you just season and cook it properly. Both tasted very fishy to me. Salmon that tastes overly fishy, to me, screams “this fish is not fresh”. Mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes. Don't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes. I get it, you wanna have a mom and pop shop. But to do that you need to have great food.  Overall, I just don't think this place is good, and don't want to go back.
Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews.   There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude.   The seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less).   The menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up.   The other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while.   I think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's.
This company is HORRIBLE!! They don't know the meaning of customer service. If you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from Lowes or Home Depot request another service provider. The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer. Said nothing was wrong. After they tech left I found a scratch on my washing machine glass top. This company is full of crack pots who need a reality check. Nice job Julie!
This review is solely based on my experience in the prayer room. It is upstairs tucked into a quiet corner with very little foot traffic which means no interruptions. The chapel as it is called is interfaith and contains a Quran,bible, and Torah available. There are also prayer mats for Muslims, and an altar to kneel at. I believe they also have have sacrament available for communion but you need to contact staff.  Being Muslim I really appreciated the quiet serenity to be able to pray without feeling rushed to do so. I used the room twice upon arrival an departure when praying the second time around I was joined by a catholic gentleman so the room does get use. Thank you CD airport for a blessing to passengers needing a place to pray and worship.
Bought an item from there, didn't notice it was an open item until i checked out. Took it back 5 days later because one of the buttons didn't work, and they refuse to take it back claiming i dropped and damaged it. I never dropped it, i brought it back to them in the same condition they sold it to me as.  Then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition. But they sure sold it to me. BUYER BEWARE.
I really wanted to get grub at Price's, but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.  Came here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly, none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.  I guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte, found a free spot, and wasn't towed when I was done eating here.
Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.  Starving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask.
Worst service in the area, by far.   Once we were seated, it took the waitress 25 minutes to make her way to our table to take our drink order.  We finally decided to settle up 45 minutes after placing our order.   The food never made it to our table.   I have eaten at this restaurant before and  the service wasn't so bad.   The food is generally pretty good.  If you want to order Chicken, definitely get it shredded.
Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife, dad, and grandpa, while paying a little visit to Charlotte.  My dad and grandpa live in Charlotte and told us we had to try Mert's.  Cornbread was excellent - we all got our own little loaf as a starter.  Entrees come with two sides and I got the pulled pork as the main dish and okra and green beans.  The pulled pork was a little stringy and very vinegary, but unique.    Wife got the salmon cakes and I didn't really care for them.  I told her she shouldn't have ordered that, but oh well.  Her mac and cheese was great though.  My grandpa ordered the fried chicken and it looked great and he really enjoyed it.  I tried a few bites and it was very moist and crispy.  I don't remember what my dad ordered...  I like how they have tons of cool side dishes here and they're all soul food-type items.  We have tons of good restaurants in Southern California, but nothing like Mert's.  If I came back, I'd probably order the fried chicken, or the catfish if I'm feeling exotic.  They probably have about 20 or so sides - a good mixture of carbs and veggies - I wish I tried the fried green tomatoes...  Well I'll be back someday to try something different.  I'm glad my dad and grandpa took us here!
Carowinds in my opinion is crap. Poor customer service in all parts of the park. Managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it. Six flags a few hours away is so much better. Carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money. The food is very pricey and its not that great.
I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a “slightly better quality school lunch burger”.  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings.
Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car.  Nice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol
There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.  I had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.  Their service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless, & saladless for the longest time.  For our dinner, we were given a salad, entree, & tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag & doused with some cheap dressing.  It didn't taste fresh at all.  There was a list of 8 or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper & cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made & cut awhile ago & just kept cold in their fridge.  The redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor & old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  I've never been to one & was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees & intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny & interactive -- my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad.
As you might be able to tell from my schizophrenicly changing stars for this place, my experiences have varied.  Some things that do not ever change, with my latest experience in parentheses: -They seem to carry only the tastiest wines.  (Pascual Toso Reserve Malbec '08) -Their cheeses are also amazingly amazing.  (American Plate w/ Buzzed from Utah and a perfectly aged Gouda) -Their food is great.  (Lasagna)  However, -The kitchen ran out of pizza, mac&cheese (which is what i wanted), and lasagna (luckily i made the cut).  That's easily half their menu!  We subsequently had to change our orders twice as the bad news kept rolling in.  By the end of the night our poor server was like the Angel of Death since each time I saw him I got nervous that he was going to come tell me that whatever it was I had ordered was yet again 86ed. -Then the food that we WERE able to order took over 45 minutes to show up. -Then the Reverse Happy Hour cocktails were inconsistent (different colored Pomegranate Margaritas, one Pineapple Cosmo that tasted great, but a 2nd that had a coffee flavor - which they gladly replaced for a good tasting one).  Overall I ended up paying WAY too much for a lackluster experience.  What really peeved me off was that I had recommended this place to our party of 14, with the hope that I could show them how awesome places in CenPho are, since they're all suburbanites.  So thank you Cheuvront, for making me look like a fool and giving my friends one more reason to stay in the 'burbs  :(
Hot links were very average. Terrible texture.
They take great care of our pets here. We rarely have much of a wait, and all of the staff are courteous and talented in handling and caring for pets. All of the vets we have met with were professional, friendly, and very capable.
I had not been to Betos in many many years.  Boy has the place grown up.  Still the same pizza that you will either love or hate.  The Pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it.  Tastes really good.    I also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people.   Was not to crowded, but full Saturday at lunch.  Highly recommended.
I love Culver's as a company, first.  They are solid through and through.    Each location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well.  I've never been disappointed with any Culver's at which I've eaten.  This location does everything well.  I work near here, so I go here at least once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  I have never had a single complaint.  Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well and getting the food out fast and hot.  The only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't great.  It could get fixed.  If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru.
Only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order. Chili verde was ok but not worth $11. Husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland.
Fantastic business - the best in town!!! I so appreciate the love and care these ladies provide to my kids when I drop them off. They always look AMAZING when they come home with cute hair or clean teeth. I am obsessed with my little dogs and hate leaving them with strangers. These gals are like family!!!
This was bar food heaven. Looks like a regular neighborhood bar on the outside and inside. We stopped by around 9 and there was about a 20 minute wait for a table. The places looks like it only fits about 75 people max.   Waiting for a table we sat at the bar and I noticed they had a great beer selection on tap and I'm not talking Anhueser Busch B.S. Lots of craft beers and a good amount of local brews. I tried a few high ABV brews that were really good and put my head in another world. I had been in town for about 3 hours by this time I'm really liking Charlotte. For dinner I tried something called “What It Is”. it's a Cajun pasta dish. Being Cajun, I was hesitant to try cajun food so far away from the deep south but they came though. I considered licking the plate. I was actually sopping up the sauce with bread like I usually only do at home. I was thoroughly impressed.
I've been taking my dogs to East Maryland Animal Hospital for 14 years, and I can't imagine going anywhere else.  Over the years my dogs have seen all of the doctors and each of them provided great medical care and advice.    After every medical appointment, I received a follow-up call the next day asking how my dog was doing and if I had any questions.   I wish people doctors were so attention!    The staff is friendly and personable and always treated my dogs with love and kindness.    All of my dogs have recently passed away after living long and healthy lives thanks, in part, to the great care they received at EMAH.   When we get another dog, we'll definitely be back!
Only reason I come here is because I get $5 off the total before 9am on Sunday. This recent experience, they forgot to clean the dashboard (dust, dust and more dust) and I almost drove off with the marker of my wash on my windshield?! Those are the two most important parts to clean after a car wash!!!!  If I didn't need to come here, I wouldn't. Plain and simple.
Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky, tacky, tacky. Loud wall paper. Lots of different rooms. And the people. Oh, the people! Men in Hawaiian shirts or local team jerseys. Women with big hair and lots of screaming kids. Staff is usually quick to greet and really quite friendly. Standard Mexican fare is widely available. Stick to the combo platters and you may leave happy. The carnitas entree is a sad clump of dry pork...gee, I think that's the same thing my Uncle Larry said of his third ex wife. Anyhoo, the chile con queso is quite yummy and actually not on the menu. You have to ask for it. Served with a variety of blue, yellow and red corn chips, the dippin is fun and filling. The guacamole is pretty good although it seems there's a little filler in there therefore the avocado flavor suffers a bit. I really like the mini chicken chimichangas. The minis, not the regular sized. The latter are a bit tough and big and hard enough to use as a door stopper. Macayo's is a family owned, famous Phoenix restaurant landmark. The Central Ave. location happens to be in my hood and sometimes the convience outweighs the dee-lish factor. My recommendation is two shots of chilled Patron before the food and everything seems better. Hola and adios!
Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food.
I must say I am very disappointed with the way it's establishment is ran, we had a group of kids (7) some with experience and some not, then they put 3 adults In the adult kart and ran all over the kids and ran almost 36 sec faster, not a safe experience for the younger kids.
I went to OPH for dinner and decided on the eggs, bacon and pancakes. The pancakes and bacon were pretty good. The eggs I ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me. Two things stood out to me about the service. I was drinking coffee and the waitress asked if I wanted my coffee topped off with 'decaf' - I wasn't drinking decaf. Also, when I asked for more pancake syrup she brought me the almost empty (used) syrup from the neighboring table.... yuck!
Though the name of the store has changed over the years, this brick and mortar has been around since I was a kid.  My grandparents have always referred to it as the “ghetto market”.  LOL  What can I say, some may feel that the neighborhood is a “ghetto”.  But cest la vie, it's the neighborhood I grew up in and went to grade school right around the corner.  You want a huge store with shiny new lights and fixtures, there's Fry's right down the street.     Anyhow, you simply can NOT beat their produce prices.  In fact, if I simply need veg for a dinner, I'll drive here than go to Fry's because Food City produce beat Frys. Example -  Food City Bananas - 3lbs for 99cents.   Fry's Bananas - 1lb for 57 cents. Buying Food City Bananas - 42% savings   Pretty sweet!  :)
Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!
When there's this much hype about a place, it's hard to live up to, but they did a pretty damn good job. Maybe not the best sandwich I've ever had in my life, but if it was any random sandwich shop I'd happened to stumble into, it would definitely be five stars without a second thought.  The chili cheese fries were among the best I've ever had. I don't know what they do to them - it's not the chili that's particularly great, it's not the cheese that's particularly great, and it's not the fries that are particularly great. But somehow, putting them all together just turns it into unbeatable awesome.  The sandwich itself (I got the corned beef) was very good despite the fact that I hate coleslaw. But they don't mean the typical mayo-and-carrot-and-purple-onion coleslaw; they make it with vinegar and oil, so it's basically just like seasoned lettuce. They put a bit much of it on, which overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients at first, but just pull about half of the slaw off and you have a kick-ass sandwich. The hot sauce goes really well on it too. And for a pretty reasonable price, I might add. Normally, I'd expect it to be about twice as much with that kind of reputation and downtown location.
I stopped in one day when I first moved here and sampled a couple of things, the chicken teriyaki, the fried gyoza, and some kind of drink. Nothing was fresh, everything tasted like old fryer grease or freezerburn (except my drink). To their credit, the service was immaculate. The women who helped me was super friendly and made suggestions of things I should try on my next visit (when pigs fly). I am really amazed by the positive reviews here. Unfortunately, this place is just a couple blocks from my house so I have to deal with the nasty stench from their deep fryer when I walk to the lightrail on my way to work.
For the all hype this places gets, it sure didn't live up to it. Sure, it was busy- what place isn't on a Friday night in Wisconsin. Rail drinks were prices right- two drinks for $6.00. I ordered the lake perch- what a DISAPPOINTMENT. If you've been to Door County/eastern WI and had perch there, don't bother with Tobys perch. It was not good. My cottage cheese was warm, and my date's “salad” was lettuce with salad dressing plopped on it. No veggies, croutons- nothing. The server was nice enough, for bring so overwhelmed and busy.
I'm not an avid go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the worst that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA, Boston, and Vegas and what all of those places had that this lacked was a safety/training person/video to tell you what the safety rules are.  This place, all you do is sign up via computer, pay your way and you (not guided) look for the entrance to put your track suit on. No one in the room to tell you what to put on. No one in the room to tell you where to go. So you find your way to the track and wait in the line to drive. Again, no training video, no guide to tell you what is what, what the rules are, etc. You just get in your car and drive. I wouldn't mind the lax safety/security procedures so much if my brother and I didn't get YELLED at by the manager/owner on the track. His exact words were, “WHERE ON PLANET EARTH CAN YOU STILL DRIVE WITH YELLOW LIGHTS FLASHING?”  If I'm expected to stop at yellow lights on your track, you've got to tell me before we start racing. (Backstory: the yellow lights were on because someone crashed; okay so why do I need to use caution in other parts of the track where the crash isn't...we slowed as we got closer to the crash site ... that's when we got yelled at! We were like, whoa, where the heck did that come from. That's what ruined the racing experience.)   This place doesn't hold a candle to K1 or F1.
Pretty good subs. The pastrami is to die for.
They now charge for their Wi-Fi and for some reason I didn't have a shower curtain. When I went to complain the woman at the front desk did not care. She said do you need one now? And I stated I'm checking out why would I would need one now I want to complain. She then gave me a look with attitude and I walked out. I'll never stay here again.
I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise, the prices suck (beer served in 10 ounce cups on special for $2.50 - come on), the food is mediocre, and the atmosphere is nonexistent.  The drinks are weak as well.    If you're looking for a night out, there are better places close by in Shadyside.  The deck really is nice, but it doesn't help the fact that the prices are terrible for drinks, especially for what you get.  That being said, I end up here a lot because others seem to like it...maybe I'm missing something.
G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced.   The server was nice and everything went well.   The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk.
My fiancee and I have been putting off going back to see the University of Illinois campus for a while now. We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.  This is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad. Honestly though, unless it is a crazy deal like we had, there are better hotels in the area. There is even a nicer Super 8 near Lincoln Avenue.
I got the best, most thorough car wash at Danny's! Unlike some of the other chains, they did not try to high pressure me into upgrades. They dried out the door jams. And the windshield was streak free. I'll be back often.
Comfortable, friendly, affordable.  Nice stop before an evening out.  I need to head there primetime to assess the evening vibe.  Will be back.
Mediocre pizza, HORRIBLE service.  We told the waiter that we were in a hurry and it still took 45 minutes to get the food.  We had two minutes to eat it and it was boring.  Then I got to argue with the waiter, so that was fun.  Go to the Parlor.  It's got better pizza and WAY better service.
I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh.   With my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns.   The ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course).   Collared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either.   Service was friendly & efficient.   Warning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!
I have been a regular here with my husband for a long time and it never let's me down. The only down side is the price of food. Honestly I'd be still willing to pay because I love this place so much. We always get the filet and some sort of fish. You also can't go wrong with the roasted corn and sweet potato baked in the beautifully presented green chili. Love the beer and wine selection aswell.
So I was visiting Arizona for spring training baseball and pining for a decent meal when we stumbled across Welcome Diner.  This place friggin' rules.  All of the food that our party tried--duck burger, breakfast biscuit, creole breakfast--was off the chain.  And they service beer, which is perfect for a Sunday brunch.    The staff was friendly and the service excellent.  They take pride in their craft, and you can see why when you taste the food.  If you're looking for a place to get some soul-nourishing food with a soulful flare, this is the place for you.
Been there three times and each time it got better.  Most recent dinner was with a party of 14.  A large crowd for a smal place but they made it work.  Everyone was extremely pleased with their meal.  The lobster ravioli & salmon specials were top notch.  The service was even better than the food if that is possible.  Best restaurant in the burgh & it's BYOB to boot.  Make sure you have reservations.
The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.  I've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here.
The lady at the register mean... The wait was like they left to a different restaraunt to get out food...
Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.  The center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with “Asian” architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.
This should say it all: we found a dress we loved, it was in our price range, but...we didn't return because of the customer service  I suppose we could have gotten over it to get the dress, but we just didn't want that negative experience to taint our wedding. It was all going so well too. The people helping us were very down to earth, very accommodating and helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. But when we told them that we weren't ready to buy the dress, it was like Jekyll and Hyde and we were given attitude and a cold shoulder. We're talking passive-aggressive teenager-like behavior. Let me be clear - we didn't say no, we didn't say we were going to go somewhere else - all we said was that we weren't ready. In all likelihood we were going to be back in a couple weeks and buy, and just wanted to think about it one more time. It's a purchase that costs thousands of dollars; shouldn't you as the bride be able to take your time?  Anne Gregory is probably the only shop in town worth going to for higher-end, couture dresses. But we've been to nice boutiques across the country and this was the only one that gave us the huffy attitude you historically associate with those types of places. Disappointing.  A few practical notes: - They don't allow pictures. Some shops do, some shops don't. - I think there's a private lot but if you end up parking in the strip mall parking lot next door or on the street, the spaces are metered so bring your quarters. - always judge for yourself...to get a sense of their collection you can go to their facebook page and see what dresses they've actually sold. take care not to confuse the posts they make of other wedding dresses and pictures of dresses by actual customers.
I have lived near here for two years and always wanted to stop in for breakfast or lunch (they don't do dinner). The waitresses were very friendly and you could tell that most of the people in here were regulars b/c they were all being called by name - nice touch.   I ordered coffee (black), two eggs, country ham with biscuit and grits. The food came out in about 5 minutes and it was freshly cooked and hot. The menu said their eggs are farm raised but did not ask if they were local. The coffee was refilled often and they also brought out a huge glass of ice water.   I love places like this, look bad from the outside, inside it has white and black checkered floors with red vinyl seats, no frills, but the food was very good.   Price was right too. I will go back :-)
Tessaro's, I kept hearing, was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award, in my opinion, is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!  A huge plus to Tessaro's for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro's butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this.   Tessaro's is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh, and they aren't open on Sundays so steer clear of that day.
I took my car here to get my brakes replaced.  They did the work quickly and at a good price.  I went here on a recommendation from a friend, and now I recommend it to my friends when they need work done.
You've gotta get the fried fish sandwich! While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had. The mac and cheese was a good call (more on the gooey side) and the fish, while messy, was simply astounding. All for approx $10 too. plus they're a local Charlotte family chain, which I absolutely adore. Service was prompt. The only thing is that they close at 3pm.   If I ever get to come back to Charlotte, I'll pick up some Showmars!
there should be a negative rating on here.  one star is way to high. i am sick and tired of how the cable box is never working their solution? KEEP RESETTING THE BOX... YES IT IS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE I GET MY SERIVCE ON A DAILY BASIS.  IT'S NOT THEIRS TO MAKE SURE IT WORK.  Plus they have poor customer service but I don't blame the people that answer the phones but the people who st the rules to nickel and dime it's customers.   charter is horrible and since i coudn't get thru to complain on the phone here is my truth.  Charter is the worst.
Got a cough or a cold. Sniffles taking the best of you. This CVS location is more than your typical drug store. A drive thru pharmacy is located in the back. Along with a healthcare clinic to help you when in need. Stressful day at the job or need some pick me up there is a small liquor isle. Don't forget to pull out your CVS card to save more.
I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure, it's not a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!! Why would you order french fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad rating about this place.  I live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely love it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. Very good sign, trust me!! Sure, there are no waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes.  The food is absolutely amazing!!! And cheap!!! My boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no heavy sauces. And it's amazingly filling.  I always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that.  The pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced beef, then layers of noodles and a cream sauce.  I bring a lot of friends to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good. The gyro meat is fresh, in fact they carve it right there.  There is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some “unsavories” and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win them all. Keep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit the ATM on the way.  You will not be disappointed with this place. This place is really a gem!!!
My cookie had no fortune.
I love the Capital Brewery because I think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially Wisconsin. Capital Brewery makes consistently high-quality German lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. The beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. Trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as Westside Andy and the Mel Ford band. People bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. Bring your own food - some local joints like the Roman Candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. And if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the Bier Stube, Capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. I highly recommend the Capital Brewery. And don't forget to take the short tour!
Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch, brunch, or dinner, the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure, I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh, but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also, the desserts are mandatory!    The duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.    A nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria.
I usually take my car to the Honda center for maintenance, but thought I would try a locally owned shop, and found The Chet's Car Care  had excellent reviews. The staff was very friendly, and the service was excellent. I will definately stay with The Chet's Car Care for all of my car's needs!
Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day.
Mu Shu was closed so we gave this place a try for takeout. Sundays and Asian food, I know. I'm Asian.  Currently suffering worst food poisoning in this decade, the kind that tears your back up from violent heaving.  Don't get chicken.
I have only been here a few times. Service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes. First time I got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the 6 bucks. I looked forward to having another some day. Last Friday I went there for another shake and it was really thin. Like chocolate milk! Maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results. $6 is way too much for a watery shake. Get it together people.
I'm here pretty regularly, since it is within walking distance of my house. Sometimes I feel like I'm paying a bit too much, but I've started frequenting the specials and Happy Hour menu, which has alleviated some of that. I've tried the sushi, the gyozo bowl, the salads, and some of the pasta dishes. Everything has been pretty good.  The gyozo bowl is awesome. It reminds me of the spicy Korean ramen my mom would make me with mondu (Korean dumplings). It's pretty spicy and flavorful. I love sitting at the bar and ordering--things come out faster and you can watch with excitement as the cooks prepare the food. I've noticed a lot of the flavors run together and taste similar, but I'm okay with that because they're good flavors.  From the outside, it really does look like a shady asian spot, but the inside is quirky and classy. The walls are brick and the decorations are well-chosen. It's a good place for a date or to meet a friend for a casual happy hour.
Was in Charlotte for two days and Merts Heart & Soul was recommended by everyone. Good food great location and I was impressed by the price. I went for Dinner Saturday then brunch on Sunday. I recommend it to
The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one star is because I really had a good appointment with Whitney Padgett, the nurse practitioner. She was kind, down-to-earth, smart and a good listener. However, in the end it was the doctor and one of the front office staff members who are the reasons why I won't return to this practice. As a 30-year-old married woman who moved to Scottsdale from CA, I was hoping to establish a relationship with an OBGYN here in the Valley so that I already have a trusting relationship with a doctor when my husband and I decide to have a baby. I was a happy patient of my last doctor for 12 years.  I scheduled my first appointment at this practice as a new patient and was seen by Whitney Padgett. It has always been my understanding that standards of care require doctors to actually see a patient if it is his or her first time going to a specialist. I was a bit shocked that I was seen only by Whitney and never a doctor at all, even though I was new to the practice. This aside, I returned for a second appointment and this time I saw Dr. Carol Hahn. I came to my appointment with Dr. Hahn for a problem and not the usual annual appointment, so naturally I was a bit worried. From the moment she walked in, Dr. Hahn was curt and condescending. She spoke to me as if I were below her. (I'm a professional working women who is married to a doctor) She typed notes on her keyboard with little eye contact. And, at one point corrected me as I was speaking about my health and at another point she made an unprofessional joke while performing my exam. However, the real shock to me came when she tilted her head down and asked me in a tone as if I was a teenage girl, “Are you sexually active?” I know this is a standard question, but my chart indicates that I am a married woman and that I take oral birth control for pregnancy prevention. Do you think she could have read my chart?? Or perhaps glanced at the clinical notes from my first visit to the practice? As I left this appointment, I was paying my co-pay and getting ready to head to work, I was told that I could not leave without paying the bill from my previous appointment. I explained that I had just received the bill two days prior for my previous appointment and had it at work with a stamp in my outgoing mail. I was told that I could not leave the building without paying that bill in person right then and there. When I explained that I'm still within the due date and that I have it ready to go in the mail, the lady told me that I would need to wait for a manager to approve it before I could leave. I told her that I needed to get to work and that I did not have the time to discuss this. I put the charge on my credit card to appease them and finally walked out the door. I can tell you that I will never return to this practice again. From the level of care I received to the treatment and finally the billing practices, this place was an unpleasant experience.
We have been going to Caring Hands with our dogs and cats for many years.  Dr. Curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog, all well into old age with great quality of life.    Dr. Curt also saw us through the adoption of a new dog, who has a specialized problem: an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters.  At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.  Dr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.  We have now seen Dr. Rebecca many times for the regular care of the “dog who lived” and the newest addition to our family, another rescue dog (who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems).  We trust Dr. Rebecca implicitly.  The staff at Caring Hands are also amazing -- good with people, competent at the animal health care business, loving to animals and able to calm and handle them.  The staff has low turnover, and some of them, like Gigi, have been there as long as we have.    You could not choose a better vet service in the Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas.  If you are at some distance in an outlying small town (as we are), they are well worth the drive.
This should have been a better experience...   I'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.  Then the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the “lunch menu” said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us “Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri”.  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.    What could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention “that doesn't apply” until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.
Fun bar, and instead of typical bar food they lean towards Greek dishes. The blue grass jam on Wednesdays is a lot of fun and not too loud to still enjoy a conversation. Decent beer prices, pretty good selection.
Lovely, serene, and everything I needed before I started my week of class. Go in the daytime when cooler weather, and go at night when hotter.  They light up the place at night.  I felt privileged to go when Chihuly glass displayed (till May 2014).
What happened to all of the coverage on the local sports?  The Arcadia News used to be very supportive and involved in Arcadia High School athletics.  No articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days.  Shouldn't a local paper support its local high school?
There were six employees behind the counter and one customer waiting for their sandwich to be made, and I was the only person in line and couldn't get a single person to take my order.  Walked out and got faster service at Panera, which had a line out the door.  Oh well.
Wife and I had the opportunity to attend a YELP event ! The show was called “Circus Americana”. Seating was great, don't believe there is a bad seat in the theater. Staff was very nice, bathrooms very clean. Parking is just across the street. Would like to come back and see other performances!
Great location, Front Desk Staff were very personable. Be prepared to hear fireworks from PNC Park it is right across the river. There is a parking deck across the street with very reasonable rates. My husband and I had a great time here.
Oh for the love of God this place is boring. Pottery and pictures of pottery.   I came here for some tour a few years ago. I was so bored I went outside and took a nap next to giant flower pot. Then I came back here last month for a charity event and also took a nap, this time in the bathroom.  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
everything was sold out when i needed to be in Charlotte and so I tried this location mainly because it was available for my dates. I was worried that it wouldn't be nice, but i was pleasantly surprised!   The room was clean, well decorated and had a bedroom and separate living room with its own tv, it also had a small well equipped  kitchen (I didnt use it) but it had pots, pans, 2 burners, a full size refrigerator and sinks etc.   They didn't have a yucky comforter, but a nice duvet too and plenty of pillows, which I insist on! :)  They had a good desk with free internet and the comminity areas were nice, inside they had breakfast (which i was always too late for - ends at 9am) but looked nice and they also have a bar that stays open late in that same spot - outside is a common area with a fire pit and lots of seating.  They have a little store with most essentials in the lobby 24 hours too. I had a terrible Dr. Pepper craving at like midnight and was able to get one downstairs.. thank goodness! I also grabbed coffee in the morning only to have my boss tell me we were going to Starbucks and I accidentally said RIGHT in front of the desk clerk -   ”Oh! then i won't drink this crappy coffee... “   I felt so bad as soon as I said it.. i am sure it is not crappy!   I would stay here again, it was comfortable and affordable. The parking is kinda weird, but over all I was very impressed.
Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling “Hey!” until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare. Well, needless to say, we didn't go back and had a fine dinner elsewhere. Tip to the house: Insulting the public is no way to win friends or customers.
I have this place on my Top 3 list for wings. They are the perfect standard wing if your looking for consistency they win all the time. I haven't been in a while but I'm sure when I do they will be spot on as usual. Always a great bartender at this place as well.
If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.  Oh, you're still here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.  The way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning. Somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions. Yes, even the “mixing” part. They apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen, and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it.  When paying my bill at the front I was asked, “How was everything?”. I replied in a polite tone, “O.K.” Cashier boy responds in bewilderment, “Just 'O.K.'?!?” I finally leave him with, “I'm being nice when I say 'O.K.'“  I'm sticking to Taylor's, Matt's and 5th Avenue Cafe for my weekend breakfast.
Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back.   I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started.   For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!  I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience.   When I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!
I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive and really cared that we had a good time.  There is live music on some nights which always makes for a good time.  Looking at the other reviews, I think the food is kind of hit or miss.  I guess I was lucky with the red beans and rice, it was really good by my standards at least.
I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner, and affiliated with Presbyterian as well, and so any time they want to order up something that they can't handle in the office, guess where they send us?  To make matters worse, the place is always full (or overfull), always understaffed, and always incapable of handling anything.  The emergency department is horrid, but to make matters worse, it's better than being admitted.  In one of the worst cases of mismanagement ever, what should have been a simple examination - passed from our regular doctor - ended up being at least 12 hours in the emergency room while we waited for a regular room, then several days (yes days) in the hospital itself while they proceeded to run a whopping one test per day.  That's right - one test per day!  The test would usually be run in mid-morning, and the results would come back mid-afternoon, at which point they would try and find someone to interpret the test results, which could take until after dinner, and by the time that happened, it would be night time, and then another test would be ordered for the next day.  It was simply pathetic.  Whatever you do, do not go to the emergency room at Presbyterian.
So bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review. Went for lunch with family (wife and 3 young boys). We've learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious. First off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen in/out door. Next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table. Then when asked what the specials were I was told “um, not sure let me check”. My food (turkey club) was eatable but my wife “salad” consisted of brown lettuce. The kicker is that my boys (2 and 4) didn't eat their hotdogs because they tasty “yucky”. How can you mess up a hot dog????  Seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game, just don't eat.
I have been to the Actor's Theatre for several productions now, and I always forget to review them.  From Chaps to the Evil Dead to Rocky Horror, some are packed, some are, well, less than packed, but they never disappoint.  If you should happen by on opening night, they typically have an extra special event where you get some tasty goodies from the sponsor (seems like it is usually the same one, but it may change from show to show) as well.  They also have a cult movie night on (all? many? some?) Mondays with free admission and popcorn, so be sure and check that out if you are looking for something to do.  Like most places, they have a nice little bar, and drink prices are not too bad, but it would be nice if they would give you the whole beer instead of pouring 2/3 of it or so into a cup.  I do not know if they keep the extra little bit for themselves or the next guy in line, but it is just one of those things that can be a little annoying, you know?
Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.    My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold.  No bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.   There were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.  When a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, “thank you.”  All the “Best of Phoenix” favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old. The bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird. We vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town.  Save your money.
A friend from out of town wanted to eat there so a group of us went here last night. When we got there there was a table open and we were seated immediately but there was a line outside while we were eating. The food was very good, everyone liked it. It was not the best I have ever eaten but still very good. The portions were not large but enough I didn't leave hungry either. Service was reasonable but not great. Considering this is a fairly small place and it was extremely busy I cannot complain. Overall it was a good experiance and we left happy.
This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews, but I didn't want someone to get suckered in like I did.    The one good thing that I will say about this restaurant was that the food was very cheap.  However, I could not stomach but a few bites so I still did not get my money's worth.
Like any Barnes & Noble, it has a nice comfy cafe, and a large selection of books.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They stock a decent selection, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Obviously it's hard for them to compete with Amazon.  However since all the small shop bookstores are gone, it's nice to walk into one every once in a while.
I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, hoping I'd find a place to get my hair cut after moving to Pittsburgh from NJ. Maybe it was just the hairdresser I booked an appointment with, but I did not have a great experience. I'm a nurse who works mostly day shifts, and I value sleep over styling my hair in the morning. I tried to articulate that I wanted a hair cut that required minimal styling on my part. The hairdresser immediately shot me down, asking me how I expected to have my hair look nice if I wasn't willing to put work into it. She then berated me for not using styling products-- again, I'd rather sleep.   Now, maybe a few people feel differently about their hair, but all I wanted was a cut that allowed for minimal styling on my part. I wasn't asking for some trendy 'do that needed 3 different products, a round brush, and a flat iron in order to re-create it. I ended up getting almost the same exact cut I had going in there (just an inch shorter). Oh, and she also told me the cut I had coming in wasn't entirely flattering because of it's blunt ends--- funny, I ended up with the same thing.   This experience has definitely made me decide never to go back, for $50 I expect a little bit better service and a little bit nicer treatment. Oh, and somewhere that isn't constantly pushing products.
Really good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout.   If you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat.
Pittsburgh isnt a city known for its culinary prowess, but there are little gems around town that I can always find myself going back to. Its not about amazing food, its not about cheap food, its about good value, and thats what Trams is. Their spring rolls might not be something to write home about, but the coconut vermicelli is great, and something you are seldom to find elsewhere, in fact, i havent ever had that anywhere else in my american dining experiences. vietnamese coffee is like intense dessert here, and a nice sugary-caffeinated pick me up thats not unwelcomed. Go to trams! get some noodles n'at!
I don't know, maybe I'm not clear on the concept of Whole Foods.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really wrong with shopping at Whole Foods.  Whole Foods does have wonderful merchandise, but...  I have found that I can buy a lot of the same organic things and environmentally safe cleaners at Giant Eagle for less.  Thier wine and beer selection, supposedly quite remarkable in other states, well remember, this is Pennsylvania.  You can't buy those things at the grocery store.    I can get just as good quality meat and produce in the Strip District.  Sometimes, even better quality.  I guess the benefit of Whole Foods  is that you can find a lot under one roof and don't have to spend a lot of time and gas going to different stores.  I'm not slamming Whole Foods at all, but I actually like Trader Joe's better.
Two words: Overpriced and understaffed.  I'm not sure if Palazzo is always open “sometimes” or just recently reopened, but they've brought back the goth night one Friday a month. Just to clarify-not reviewing that particular dance night, just the establishment itself.   Every time I have been, the bar has been understaffed. Two for an entire nightclub that is packed? How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people.   Also? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment. It's sad because this event is attempting to revive the goth scene yet the venue that it's at (which used to be Tranzylvania back in the day) just plain sucks.
I have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors. However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of “respect” to what a customer orders.  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken.  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish.  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen City.
We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.
We spent 20 minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out...  We were told it would be about 15 mins. We waited patiently at the hostess stand, while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces. Various tables were empty and not being bussed, and another table was actually cleaned and ready. No clue what was going on...there was no one at the hostess stand, no apparent 'leader' to be seen.   Hoping it was just an off night...when I return to give them a second chance I still update my review
A very odd experience.    We entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.    Once you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.    Finally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.    They feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.    The entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about.
Gross, what happened?! It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's. It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day.   This last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience.   Blah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better.
This place never fails! Curry is amazing. I always get the red bean curry. The service is always fast and courteous. Perfect to sit in and done or to-go. Its BYOB so feel free to bring a beer or wine bottle.
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.  I went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever.   I know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless.   The service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.  I won't be going back.
This is a scam... They're pretending to be another shop and they're really sunwest auto trying to rip you off. The real Simon and sons is a dif number and address. I was ripped off and both shops were caught in lies when confronted. Going to the better business bureaus to file complaint
Red alert. Red Alert.   If you are looking for good mobile phone customer service, this is not the store. I'm changing my provider to Verizon or AT&T after the experience I had last night. Here's how it went down....  I headed in around 6:30pm as my contract expired so I needed to upgrade my phone and sign on for two more years. When I entered, I noticed around eight employees out front and three in the back...so I thought to myself, this won't take long, there are a ton of people working. I signed in with the “receptionist” who told me the wait to buy a new phone would be 10 minutes. No biggie, I told her, I'll just go check out all the gadgets.   Forty minutes later I was still waiting - and showing as third on the list for service. Now this wouldn't be a big deal if I wasn't watching the employees talk to each other and head into the back for long periods of time while customers were waiting out front. I literally timed two people between customers - one waited over 15 minutes before helping someone else and the second employee wasn't helping anyone when I left and it had been 20 minutes since his last customer.   Needless to say, I left the store...but not before telling them to take me off the list so the poor people in line after me didn't have to wait even longer. I will not be back and have been researching other providers today.
This is our first time coming to Brixx and we really enjoyed it. We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola and the Bronx Bomber. The  Pear and Gorgonzola was unique. The Bronz Bomber had good flavor and a nice balance of ingredients. Personally I would have like them to be a little more crispy. But, that's just a personal preference.   What I really liked was that the manager came to each table to introduce himself and make sure the customers were happy. It's rare to see managers touch tables! Great customer service and great food
great pizza from the graziano family.   great subs, tasty sauces, nice crust, lots o beer.  no complaints what-so-ever
This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for, please visit. If you're looking for a tasty meal, go somewhere else. 5 stars for history, 0 for food quality and flavor.
Long lines before/after sporting events. Limited beer selection. Mediocre food. I wasn't impressed. I can't tell you how many times I thought it would be a good idea to stop in for a drink or snack while in the area, only to find out that a baseball or basketball game was scheduled down the street and the wait would be an hour or longer. Not worth the wait.
I had a positive experience with this shop. I needed something framed at the last minute, and within extremely precise parameters (that weren't easy to abide by), and they not only got the work done correctly and on time, but at a reasonable price.   The staff is a little gruff, but not at all unfriendly, and I am happy to have found a local shop that I will return to.
There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders.  The fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago.  The Mussels were OK.  But the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine.  The New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup.  No, we won't go back..the food was lackluster(better fix at Wholleys) and the service was terrible. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take the bill.
Cornbread!! So yummy.  We took our friend visiting here for some “soul food” and Mert's did not disappoint.  Come with an appetite!
I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind...... I hope others feel the same way......
The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time, I even had a terrible interaction with the owner.  This time I was invited with a couple of girlfriends because they love it. Decided to try again since it was more about the “get together” than the food/location.  This time, overpriced food and bad service.  Overall, it was not anything out of the ordinary and not worth the price.   I had the veal speciality.   Large portion, but ok.  Staff was not very attentive for the small amount of customers present.  I am a Pittsburgh native.  This is a bad neighborhood.   I am NOT interested in ever going back!
Monday night drink specials and an amazingly musical performance will be provided to you with a 5 dollar cover.. What more could you ask for?   This building breeds history and I was proud to experience it my last night in Charlotte.
I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay, but the nail tech was rather snotty and had attitude the entire time. PLEASE, if you are offering “discount” for customers paying in cash you have no reason to be a snot! Give me a break! The 2nd time I had the same snotty tech and she was just as expected-snotty! The pedicure was a joke and they basically do a quick rub and no true callus removal at all. The dryers they use for the gel manicure are old and trashy and have a handmade taped cardboard piece in the middle of it to help you place your hands correctly so that the gel actually adheres. Well guess what, it didn't work and my thumbs were actually chipping the next day when a gel manicure should last 1.5-2 weeks. It wasn't worth dealing with them to go back and have it fixed so instead I'll just let everyone know not to go there and instead go elsewhere.
The Sports Pub is the kind of place I tend to find myself at when I get overruled by my friends on the east side.  I don't know the east side of town all that well but I do know that I like the Ale Asylum A LOT.  I seem to be successful in getting everyone to go there about 25% of the time; otherwise we end up at the Sports Pub.  I've spent quite a few nights here and I can't really say I've ever had a good time.  If I could I'd rate this 2.5 stars, because really this place isn't that bad.  It's just that there are so many places with better beer, nicer bartenders, friendlier crowds and better food.  Every time I've gone to the Sports Pub there have been good aspects of my experience, but something always goes wrong and I leave with a bad impression of the place.    The first time, several years back, I remember having a really tasty burger, but the pitcher of Capital had little bits of gunk floating in it and the bartender tried to blame that on me.  That was enough for me to cross it off my list, but my friend really likes the place and I've been back multiple times since.  Last weekend, for example, we went for the second half of the Badger game.  It was crowded to be sure, but the service was good and my sandwich was pretty decent.  Unfortunately this was marred by the fact that we could not see a television from where the table was positioned, which kind of defeated the purpose of going to a sports bar.  I also got into a ridiculous argument with some drunk at the bar over something trivial, and I spent the rest of the afternoon hearing him loudly talk about me from across the bar.  Again, that's not really the fault of the Sports Pub but I just can't seem to have a nice time at this place.  The menu is actually pretty broad, with traditional bar food done up right.  The appetizers are the standard fare, and the spicy curly fries are really tasty.  The tap selection is on the low side of OK.  There's usually a Capital and Spotted, and aside from the aforementioned incident I haven't had a major problem with quality.  There's a foosball table near the door where I once schooled a plastered townie five games in a row before hubris got the better of me and I was resounding beaten by his girlfriend.  There are outdoor volleyball courts and leagues during the summer.  I'm sure that if I lived near this place I'd probably find it a nice local hangout.  But I don't, and every time I've made the trip over from Middleton I end up regretting the experience.  I just can't recommend the place, though I'm pretty sure that I'll find myself back there in the not so distant future.  Maybe then it won't be so bad, but I'm not holding my breath.
I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.
Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. “Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia” she said in the most uncaring, apathetic voice possible. We were heartbroken of course. “Go wait by that door and someone will meet you.” After a few minutes another woman came out and took the carrier. “I'll bring your carrier back out in a minute.” We said no, that's okay, keep the carrier. She said okay and took our cat to the back. And that was it. No kind words, no sympathetic gestures, no “Would you like a moment before I take him?” No “I'm sorry.” Nothing. For us this was one of the worst days of our lives but nobody at the ARL seemed to care, or at least have been trained to pretend to care, one bit.   They get a couple stars for offering a necessary service. But other than that, this place will only be associated with making a terrible day that much worse with their lack of caring or empathy.
Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.  THE HAIRCUT.  Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it, I was really happy with it.  I really liked the girl I had.  I thought that she cut it just how I wanted.  But then she asked if I wanted her to straighten it, and I said no thanks because I have wavy hair that's pretty easy to make fancy (read: easy as in I don't use products or heat almost ever, thanks) even though it's quite long.  Somehow, she made my wash 'n wear waves into a frizzy stuff hot mess with some combination of gels and spray.  Then, she told me she was going to dry my hair to 90% dry before sending me to the mani and then check on me later.  Okayyyyyy.  Overall, haircut & style = 3 stars.  THE MANI This mani brought down the average rating of my visit as I'd give it one star.  I haven't gotten a lot of manis--maybe a half dozen times for fancy events--but I know a bad one.  It was freaking dirty at the mani station where a different girl did my nails.  The towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it!  Seriously, get some bleach.  Then I figured out what the stains were...the girl made me bleed on two fingers while cutting my cuticles.  One bled quite a bit.  But she just pretended like it wasn't happening and continued to chatter on about Black Friday shopping and her plan to score big.  Had the mani station not been in the very back of the salon, I would have ran away when--this is true--she got up to use the restroom in the middle of mani.  Um, I usually do my own nails, but I'm guessing this isn't normal.  As if she were aiming for the worst mani ever, the polish wasn't even within the lines at all.  Then, she had me sit around in a weird corner while my nails cured and said she's get the stylist.  Mani = 1 star.  The stylist didn't come back after a couple minutes.  When I asked the receptionist where the stylist was, she didn't know.  I just wanted to get out of there.  So I took off the smock and left with wet hair and nails.  I was pretty bummed since I had specifically scheduled the appointment on that particular afternoon because I had a big event that evening.  I actually felt like a sucker tipping at more than 20% for these services.  But I had put the tips in the little envelopes before I got my nails done and I didn't want to wait for them to dry to decrease the tip.  So I tipped and left.  Summary: Free isn't great when you have to go home and immediately wash your hair and remove the nail polish.
Very expensive hotel, but very good service overall.
Happy hour is designed to make one happy. The fact they had one sat evening with things I like on it made me happy for a new hours.  There are a few 1/2 priced sushi rolls like a Spicy tuna and Phily roll. 1/2 some apps and beer $3 specials.   The rolls are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happy hour, as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or Phily roll it is hard to really mess them up. The added avacado to them was nice.  We also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.  They were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all.
You can speak to maurice about adding brewskis to the “make your own six ~pack” if one you want isn't there! ;)
Magnifico!  Great little place tucked away in a semi-residential area of town.  Felt like I was part of the family after being seated.  Bright cheerful atmosphere like a fiesta!  Food was very flavoful even the white rice.  Crab enchiladas full of white crab meat and smothered in your choice of red or green sauce.  Salsa you get red (Spicy) and green (mild) with chips and I got a complimentary Cerviche.  The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and just the right kick of heat.  Can't wait to try other dishes when I return to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!
Love this place! I was visiting Pittsburgh from Houston and we decided to finish off our visit with this museum - or should I say museums. Coming from Houston where we have some pretty good museums, this was a pleasant surprise - really cheap considering you get both Art and Natural History. The dinosaur exhibit was so interesting and educational.  The gem and mineral exhibit was huge. And the art museum had a surprisingly awesome collection - I was thrilled to see a couple Van Goghs, Monets, Cezannes, etc. The only exhibit I didn't much care for was the temporary art exhbit - some contemporary craziness that involved body parts dangling from the ceiling.. at least it gave us something to talk about. All in all I did not spend nearly as much time here as I could have and would have liked. I highly recommend this for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.
My family of 5 went for dinner on a Saturday night. We had a reservation for 6:30 granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost 7. The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.
a classic. nothing else to say
This was my first experience eating Jack in the Box since I moved from GA to AZ 2 days ago. The service was horrible! Cashier had attitude when I told her I was still reviewing the menu. When I was ready to place my order she was very rude & sighing as if she needed me to speed up. Then I watched as she prepared her food, placed it on a tray & walked off as my food sat in the window. The drive-thru person came to see if I had been helped & proceeded to bag my food after I told him I was waiting. This place needs better service.
Went to Harper's this past Tuesday, it had been at least 6 months or more since I had  had the Betty's Pimento cheeseburger. Sat in the bar area with one of the new interactive tables, that was so cool! Seems like the menu is much smaller than is used to be but I did finally find my beloved burger and ordered it with fries. I told the waitress to please make sure the fries were hot because the last time I was there they had been cold and I really wanted to enjoy this visit. When I received the burger it looked different, smaller and somehow sadder. I could actually fit this burger into my mouth! That used to be impossible because it was huge and I would have to eat it with a knife and fork. The flavor was bland and instead of the cheese running down my fingers I could barely taste it and the meat was just bland. I was so sad.  So in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. I guess I will have to find a new fav burger joint.Booooooo!
Great food and generally good service. Lunch time can turn into a loong wait, but it's always worth it. Green Curry, mmmmmmmmmmm!
Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had.   We walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa.   Next time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received.
Going in - you know your going to get typical TGIF food.  But the view is great!  If you're a sports junky you need to eat here once.  We took my grandfather, a sports nut, for lunch (hopped off the light rail) and he loved it.  As we ate lunch on the “patio” we watched as the landscapers groomed the field.  The top was open, the sun was shining, a breeze was blowing...ahhh..  The service was perfect.  Our server was funny - took time to chat and made sure we had what we needed as soon (or before) we needed it.
There is serious separation anxiety when you have to leave your stylist, with whom you have established a bond, and maybe even spilled serious personal information to.   Having moved from the south, I had to leave a woman I loved and strike out into all new territory. It was the end of a 2 year relationship, and I wasn't prepared to see just any old body after that.   Then I found Nicolette at MCN. She's amazing and chill and friendly and interesting and and AND she's great at her job. Also, the salon is beautiful and the stylists range in price, so if you are occasionally living from paycheck to paycheck (like me,) you can see Jenn or Kara and get a great cut without having to scrounge through your piggy bank for a little extra.  However, if you don't like dogs, be aware that Josie, the bulldog, is frequently around and about.
I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.  The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.  Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), “stop being mean to the customers” and “be nice!”
I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also.
I am not a vegan and went there to meet friends and enjoy the atmosphere. I must say the hipster 'tude of the place was intimidating at first, but it's super friendly and retro-feeling.  Servers were fairly friendly.  We had some great lattes and chai teas and chatted for a long time without being bothered.  Didn't try the food, but there were lots of vegeterian and vegan options.
This is the first time Yelp reviews have let me down. I tried this new location due to the reviews and being 5 mins from my job. I opted for a manicure and shellac. Three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel. I called the salon and they asked I return and have the shellac redone. I did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling. This has never happened to me with any shellac or other type of gels. This was a waste of money and especially time!!
I have been here twice and it was excellent both times.  Great atmosphere.  Attentive service, but not overly so.  Good wine and drink list.  I had the scallops as an entr\u00e9e both times.  Delicious!  Tried a variety of the appetizers.  All excellent!  Definitely a top choice in Charlotte.
this place is solid,  you will never feel ripped off, ever.
Attended the Ancient Ales, Modern Science event with several others and was very disappointed.  The Ancient Ales that we had the privilege of tasting were fantastic but unfortunately only 1 or 2 of the breweries made it the whole 4 hours. We spent most of our night waiting in line for the breweries whose booths were open and didn't get a chance to see much of the Science Center, thankfully I was with good company.
Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay, then charge you late fees when their service fails to draw funds.  Not failure to draw funds from a lack of cash in the account.  No, this is a failure to draw funds because their billing department is complete and utter garbage.  Their services are sub par and they over charge for this shit service because as previously stated they run the only line available for entire neighborhoods and small towns through out the Charlotte area.
Although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good, it's severely overshadowed by the “off” taste of the beef and chicken dishes.  The beef with scallion is 90% bamboo shoots, which isn't even listed as an ingredient, and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs.
Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again, great food but super horrible service! Not sure, due to the service, that we will return the next time we are in Charlotte!
I got two pairs of shoes fixed here recently and I was very pleased with the work done and the cost.  It is a great little business to have in the neighborhood!  Make sure you call and check their hours... Saturdays are probably your best bet.
Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up, I called Front desk, they told me be patient.  I waited and called them again around 1:30pm, they hang up my phone after I explained the purpose of the phone call. I called them third time around 1:35pm, no response.  Hope they will improve quality of their service.
I don't know what it is about this place, but they are slooooooooow. The food is adequate (please don't lecture me about fast food, why are you even reading this review?), but sitting at the drive-in will shorten your life. Or maybe just feel like it.   I prefer some of their stuff to McDonald's (yes, I'm very discerning) but just cannot abide the wait.
Fritter me timbers....   I mean, corn fritters.   Not that this one little review makes any difference, but if you go, get the corn fritters.   This was my second time at Wild Thaiger and how that delicious app eluded me the first time, I will never know.   Not the biggest fan of their Pad Thai, but that's okay. There are many other very delicious options... And corn fritters.
One star for the environment very laid back and classy. Food on the other hand was not quality that we expected. Enchiladas were over powered by cheese and too soggy, and runny eggs. The tenderloin we asked medium rare definitely no taste nor quality the taste of the raw meat was not pleasing. Cocktails were not up to par either. Although service was great one more star.
I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time, new girl on the grill apologized to me at 10 minutes, at 15 I walked.  Not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff.   Tonight, the waiter seemed mad that I didn't know what I wanted to order.  After I explained that I'd never been there, he brought me a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for 10 minutes.  I walked again.  No more tries here.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Haha.
Since my return to Pittsburgh, I have been to the “new” Elbow Room several times. The food has always been decent and the location on Walnut is convenient when I'm in the neighborhood shopping.    Today I went for a late lunch.  Honestly, there were 5 people in the restaurant.  It took forever for food to arrive at our table.  Could it be attributed to the fact that I was eating somewhere between lunch and dinner and they aren't sufficiently staffed?  I don't know.  My beloved was happy as always with his ENORMOUS fish sandwich.  My reuben sandwich was just okay.  The corned beef was pretty chewy.  Probably should have gotten a salad.    I'm hoping that I just caught them on a bad afternoon.
I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves.   That said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul.
I love this place! It's walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food.  It's a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich.  The lunch is very good too! They have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Korean BBQ Sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich!  Tell them I sent ya!
We went to Harris Grill for lunch while a friend was visiting from out of town-and it was fun! The menu and atmosphere is pretty entertaining. The food and drinks are moderately priced, and there is a nice selection of brews.  What we had:  Turkey Burger-fabulous-we agreed this was the best thing we had ( I added mozzarella cheese and it was soooo good)  Flat Iron Pork-I guess our friend thought he was ordering flat iron steak-this was ok but I wouldn't get it again.  Some Spicy Chicken sandwich-Pretty good-paled in comparison to the turkey burger  Tots-Delicious  Beer-good! (duh)  Other: Service-Fab!  2 Patios-front and back
We loved this place! It's definitely a hidden gem. Service was awesome, food was phenomenal, and prices were reasonable. The waiter was very pleasant and gave great suggestions. We will be back!
Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.
Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure.
Wow. Just, wow. As a former employee of this location, I'm sorely disappointed. I used to be a hostess here and always LOVED the food. So I figured I'd take my boyfriend to grab a nice breakfast. Boy was I wrong. I ordered the huevos rancheros with chorizo (always been my favorite) and ended up with eggs and bland potatoes, with chunky sour cream (ew) and a light sprinkling of chorizo. Um, what? I paid almost 30 bucks for this? The food was bland and not good at all. I couldn't even finish my meal it was that bad. I'll never go back. How disappointing. Maybe you should stop recruiting your employees/chefs from McDonalds. The good egg has really let itself go.
Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.    My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.  And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a “what's going on here” palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.  Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.  My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: “Uh-oh”.  The menu is huge with a number of “slow-food” stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.  I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.    Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.  My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The “bacon” in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, “meat”.  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.    Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, “The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service”.  That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.  If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.    I'll never return.
I had the number 12 to go. I was disappointed with this dish. It was greasy and had too much cheese. It was also fairly bland.
Won't be back...these guys stole all my Change out of my console...generally you expect random coins in the cup holders to be taken...but they went into a closed console and stole an entire change holder...don't give these guys your business!!!
I'm from California and hotcakes is something that's not common in our food vocabulary. We just settle on pancakes and call it a day.  My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.  Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!
Big plus: the baggage claim is RIGHT next to the rental car stations. WELL DONE MADISON.   Big minus: you have to walk to a giant, hard-to-navigate parking lot to find your car/rental company. Recall that 6 months out of the year the weather can be COLD.  Edge: friendly staff. Even though they sneak a cig on the walk from the desk to the lot. Gotta keep it real.
The worst Arby's I have ever eaten at. If you want a good one, visit the one on Park.  So, here is why it is bad. 1) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at. 2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have monthly deals. 3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things. 4) their customer service is awful I don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect better than what I got here.
Where do you go when your washer and dryer break down?  How about Starcrest, which can boast it's own little “study room” with two desks, four chairs, and free wi-fi?  That's right.  I like to surf the net while separating my whites from the colors.  And no, that's not racist.  The washers are expensive--at least by my standards--$1.50 a wash, but they fit in more than your average washer.  Dryers are about 25 centers per 7 minutes, but are HUMONGONORMOUS, so all told, washing two loads of laundry came to $3 in washing and $1.75 in drying (all of it fit in that one dryer and i let it run for 49 mins).  The laundromat is clean and big, so that's a plus.  Also, the wi-fi network....is named “Chuck likes Guys”  Um, wow Chuck.  Thanks for letting us all know via internet.  We're very happy for you.  Seriously, perhaps a greeting card would've better.  I imagine Hallmark making the card, where the front would be a peaceful lake with the words: “Life has some surprises.”  Then the inside: “Like my newfound attraction to men.”  But since Hallmark isnt' yet that edgy, we have starcrest's wireless to make the announcements for us.
This place could be really great, but unfortunately as of now it sucks.  First of all, I've never been to a concert venue like this with no bar...  Call me an alcoholic, but I like my beer in hand when I'm nodding my head to some obscure hipster band I've never heard of.  The outside is kind of cool- but the inside is awful!  The walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms.  There were no decorations or paintings on the wall when I went even though I thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery.  Maybe I went on a night that they were between showings.  The space is small, but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work.  Unforch, it didn't.  The sound system seemed cheap also.  This place could be great if they just put in a bar, and hired a decorator.
Might not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it's a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name, and ask how your work day is going.  I take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.  Super affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.  Now, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot.
When we called the Motel before we arrived, they said they had plenty of rooms available, but when we got there the manager spent about 10 minutes searching for a room for us (said several were in the middle of some maintenance.  As we went to our room, we noticed there were many rooms that did not appear to be occupied at all (the drapes were open and rooms were dark.)  This was the same story and situation the past 3 times we stayed here.  I think they just close rooms off, period.  Found a used condom on floor under the bed and the wall near the sink had some drip stains from something I won't even hazard a guess about. There is no way that room had been properly cleaned or sanitized.  We will absolutely not be back here again.
Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza, so we found Musashi. I was very unimpressed. We started with gyoza and edamame. Neither were anything special. We then ordered a chicken teriyaki plate and a few sushi rolls. The chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce. Was not good at all. The sushi was mediocre at best. While they were friendly and the service was pretty good - I will not be back.
Beautiful place, nice ambiance. Ok drinks. Music could be better. The waitress was dressed very provocatively (large breasts falling out of the top of her dress- showing her panties each time she bent over- which was often)- it appeared that many ladies on dates felt uncomfortable, arms crossed immediately with the men looking at the ground... Probably more uncomfortable for the guys really- because one wrong glance or blink and that date is over!   If this is the vibe Merc Bar is going for then... well done I guess.  I will say, it is awkward when a girls large boobs are coming out of her top and she keeps bending down with her chest in your date's face... kudos to her for being an attractive young lady, but it's a bit much when it makes the guests uncomfortable.   Also,  as one woman left her table to use the restroom, I watched the waitress flirt and stroke her husband's arm up and down as she gave him the check... I have a feeling if the wife saw that.... well, I'm happy she didn't, because you just don't know how people are gonna react to that disrespectful, intrusive behavior. It knocked the place down a couple notches- not quite Hooters vibe or strip club lounge- Maybe Champagne room? I really did wonder if I got up to use the restroom, would this girl come over to feel my guy up too? I didn't like that one bit. It wasn't a good feeling to have out with your significant other- and unfortunately, this is the memory I so strongly took away. Then again, it was also interesting watching the guy that somehow ended up on a date with a transexual squirm in the corner as she insisted on playing with his hair and trying to kiss on his neck... That must have been an internet date, lol!  Also, regarding the service, each time we would ask questions about the drinks the waitress would have to go ask the bartender. It's a specialty cocktail lounge- we aren't liquor micro-biologists asking for a chemical analysis of their concoctions- just regular basic questions. It would have been nice if she would have had some level of knowledge and training- given the niche and price points.      All in all- I remember when this place was hot, back in the day- when I don't think I was even old enough to drink. It's still a nice place, but there are so many more options in this town now. Urbanity in Phoenix is progressing- gotta keep up with the times Merc Bar. When my barista knowns more about the soymilk in my Latte than this chick knows about a fresh squeezed lemon in a cocktail we have an issue.   As for the drinks... They were okay. I wasn't blown away by the choices. We ended up going to Sidebar afterwards- I love their muddled blueberrry whiskey sour- house made. Delicious! The drinks were better at Sidebar and the vibe was a little more modern less stripclub/2001 Scottsdale nightclub.  Sorry Merc.
Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service, at least once you get past the fabulous sales people. My install was scheduled for between 9-11 am on a Saturday, dude called at 2:30 to say he was the “outside guy” and was on his way. Was indignant when I asked about the earlier time frame (actually I laughed when I answered the phone and found out who he was....3.5 hrs late!), but I let him come and do at least the outside work. Called the number on my scheduled appt email at 3:30, got a woman who knew nothing about my issues, tried to transfer me to dispatch, transfer failed. She called me back, I asked for a supervisor and was on hold for 15 minutes. She called back again, tried to transfer me to somebody else, said there was a “problem” with my order, but she couldn't tell me what it was. After another 20 minutes on hold, I hung up. She called back once more, told me she would call me as soon as the department was available - never heard back. Unbelievable! Not thrilled with Time Warner or most of their contracted install/repair folks, but at least when they are going to be late or have to reschedule, they call! DON'T DO IT!
Ok this place was soo fantastic. I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely made the right choice. It tasted delicious! To top it off they include dessert with dinner. :)
I live and own my property for 11 years and the HOA will not do anything about the animal problem that has been happening for the past two years.  This cat keeps coming to sleep, release its feces, attacking birds and eating them on my property.  The HOA property manager Judy O'Claire tried to put blame on the Glendale Code Compliance as well as vice versa.  Nobody wants to take responsibility and now I have to confront the neighbors at 6402 W Lawrence Lane, hopefully I don't get shot at.  I don't understand why this management company does not take responsibility and continues to not enforce the CC&Rs.  For nine years they kept sending me warnings about my garbage containers being exposed on my yard and a few weed warnings which was not true, and now I have to deal with somebody else's wandering pet because the darn property manager thinks it's my problem.  Those neighbors need to stop feeding all the cats from this and other neighborhoods and start taking responsibility or jail, including Osselaer Company who will land in jail too.  Judy O”Claire is a racist and discriminates against disabled homeowners, she will deceive that she does not know who I am when I have confronted her over two dozen times during the 11 years I've lived there.  Beware if you are having problems with the property managers, go to the president of the company.
I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.  Yes, Majerle's is worse.    Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.  The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.    Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.    The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.  I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.
love the lobster roll.  buttery delicious stuff.  the crab/spin/artichoke dip was also yummy.  i'll go back and try other dishes.  so far so good
i hate US Airways, shitty services
I've been here quite a few times, and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.  Everytime I go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).  The food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.
Does not live up to a recent review in Madison paper.   Cons: Too pricey & ala carte.  The pasta dishes in range $15- $20. The entrees: $20 - 30. The decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty. Server forgot to put in some of our order.  My ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor.  Need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil. Plus: Nice people.  Good Tuscan mushroom soup. For the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations.  It would be fine for your corner Italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$.
Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Has always been one of my favorite diners in Mad-town.  Delicious veggie chili, spicy cornbread, malts and desserts, as well as the amazing array of other veggie options.  Just yesterday, I tried the new Spinoccoli Quiche with fruit, which was pretty darn good...coffee is always hot and refills frequent.  Still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes, but next time, I must.  I must also remember to save room for dessert!  Look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu.  Only downer is the wait/lack of parking on a busy day.  Overall, two thumbs up from me, Monty.
I hate giving 1-star reviews, but I'm not sure how else to rate the overall experience.  The Atlas Court location appears to be quite aged, extremely cramped, and lacks quality customer service. They do have a ton of equipment available, but that's about it.  I arrived on Saturday morning with my reservation for a 17' truck firmly in-hand. There was a line of people waiting to check-in/check-out equipment, and only one person working behind the counter.   The employee (a younger gentleman) appeared to be struggling with everything he did, and he wasn't shy about hiding his frustrations. After waiting for around 15 minutes, another employee (I believe he's the manager) jumped-in and helped folks. The manager was much more proficient, helpful, and friendly. I was third or fourth in line, and the manager processed all of us before the other guy finished his first customer.  When I went to get my truck, there was an equipment problem, so they substituted another truck for me. Unfortunately, the truck that I was provided was ancient - it had 204,000 miles on it, the check engine light was on, and it ran so poorly that I thought I was going to breakdown at several points along the way. The steering components were so loose that the truck weaved and swerved the entire time; I could “saw” the steering wheel from the 9:00 to 3:00 position as I drove without affecting my direction/course.  Because of the check engine light, the truck averaged 3.2 miles to the gallon. My 46 mile round-trip move required 15-gallons of fuel to complete. That is absolutely absurd. The cost to refill the truck was $50 on the dot.  Even more absurd were the fees for the truck... $29.95 for the day, $14 for insurance, and $1.09 per mile seem fair. Until they tack on additional service fees, etc. What should've cost around $70 - $80 for an in-town move cost nearly $100 + $50 for gas.   Returning the truck was even worse, as the manager was long gone, and the lone dude was back at the counter. As soon as another employee arrived to assist with the line of people waiting to check-out, the first dude announced that he was “f-ing out of here” because he had “the longest f-ing day of his life” working there. Mind you, there were 5-6 people in line when he made his proclamation.   I now remember why I've always used Penske or Budget when moving. It's unlikely I'll use these guys in the future...
This West location is now CLOSED.   Owner would like to reopen in the future.
Went in there with high expectations, Neil Brown “Who wants to be your jeweler!” never even came out of his hole in the back.  This place is over priced and will rip you off, also if you want to sell jewelry.  Don't go here!!!
Good solid mexican food.  Big portions and small prices.  If you order a burrito or chimi get it wet, I made that mistake only once!
Now let me preface this review by saying I am an East Coast gal with over 30 yrs experience in eating the BEST Pizza & I absolutely love the crust (hand tossed of course) @ Pizza Heaven. I was walking back from the Christmas light show and saw the PH sign in Neon Orange calling me into this place.  Right Choice. Since then I have been there weekly and sometimes twice a week.   The crust is crunchy and the cheese is delicately melting throughout.  I always get mine with pepperoni but when ever I spot someone else pizza looking a smelling divine (pardon the pun Heavenly) I change the order to find that I now have another favorite  Ranch Chicken Pizza. Who would have thought cheddar cheese would taste that good on pizza. TRY IT!!!!  One thing, service is different in the day time, counter lady is very helpful in knowing the menu there & that's a plus and when I come during the evening, the sit and be waited on service is not so terrific.The boys tend to sit at the counter and surf the phones and talk with the kitchen staff and forget about the tables. I'd rather come during the day or take out to get better service. Wish they had a full bar to sit at that would be fun and an outside venue too.
We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!
It takes me 25 minutes to drive there and it is well worth it. The food is phenomenal and considering its quality, the price is just right. The staff is also fantastic.   I am particularly fond of Tom who s very energetic and engaging.  Pane Bianco is an absolute gem and the kind of place I don't mind driving 25 min to get there. The fact that they are right next to Lux is also a plus.  However, I can't say the same about dinner where I had the lasagna...For $ 16, it was an abomination, all there was in there was some tomato sauce, bechamel and meat sauce...no cheese or meat sauce...altogether a huge disappointment. Never having dinner there again...
The steaks here are very good.  It's the same quality as the other high end places (prime cuts, aged, etc.).  However, I love the fact that they serve them on  platters sizzling with butter.  That's something somewhat unique compared to some of the other shops.  I love the sound of the sizzle as the plates approach the table.  I had dinner a couple of nights ago and while the steaks are top notch the bar isn't that good.  The  bartenders are competent, but the atmosphere is pretty lame.  It's kind of an afterthought it seems.  Oh yeah, and they don't have Guiness on tap.  I'm going to start a petition that  no liquor licenses should be issued without a guarantee that the proprietor have guiness on tap.  I mean, how do you not at a steakhouse?  If you  go here for dinner do your  happy hour elsewhere.  The service is very good.  The crab stuffed mushrooms are okay, but they certainly aren't noteworthy.  The mashed potatoes are great and the asparagus is okay, but I think  at high end steakhouses they should have asparagus that is as big as a baseball bat, something you can't get at the local grocery.  Overall a very fine experience.  I'd rate the chain steakhouses  in this city in this order for sit down dinners Mortons, Capital Grille,  Ruth Chris, Hyde Park.  And, for bar area and bar dining Capital Grille, Hyde Park, Mortons, Ruth Chris.
When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.      This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh.   At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?).. SO WHAT”S WITH $140 FOR A TUNE UP? Well the story goes like this:  I bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says “Should be ready in a few days”. So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would “duke it over” a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap). Plus I'll toss in a star for your outstanding selection of high end cycles. Maybe I would have rated BBB higher if I was in the market for a purchase instead of a simple repair?
Great Way to Spend the 4th.  Been awhile since I've been to Outback and they have revamped the menu a bit.  Slightly different focus with all of the favorites still there and a couple of new offerings. Also, at least this one is now open for lunch during the week so there is a new lunch menu as well.  My wife had here favortie Alice Springs Chicken.  Normally I would go with a Beef Entree but opted for a new offering of Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken with a side of mixed vegetable.  Only negative was the bread they served. It was a very dark bread that looked with an Eastern European bread with none of the texture and none of the flavor.  Fortunately that was the only downside.  My Parmesan Herb Crusted Chicken was great.  The flavors and textures complimented themselves well.  My wife was also happy with her Alice Springs Chicken which again, is her normal order at Outback.  Service was excellent and the manager did stop by our table and spoke with us which is always a good sign.  Atmosphere --- What can I say?  Typical Outback.  If you're in the Carolina Place Mall Area, this is a nice spot for Dinner and now Lunch
BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs, arms, and back. We flip a pillow over and there it was. BED BUGS. We had to cut our trip short. The man at the front desk apologized and gave us the managers name and number and told us to call back later that morning. We have been calling since 8/10 and have yet to receive a call back. Such disrespect. We risk bringing back bed bugs and spending hundreds on extermination fees and no has the decency to call back.
I have to say this eastern Carolina BBQ is some of the best I have had since when I was a child living in Greenville NC. My granddaddy use to take us to his favorite BBQ place just across the Tar River near the airport almost every Sunday for dinner. Living in Florida I don't get this type of 'Q down there. So when I am in Charlotte I make it a point to eat here. Twice now and counting.
We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.
Some the best Indian food in the valley. I am reluctant to give five star on any place, always being the explorer, but I would go 4 1/2 because there is not damn TV and the atmosphere is excellent
Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.  The staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions “all you have to do is ask”....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like “well I know you'll be back”.    Do people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle.
Review #200  I got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now, when I drive past, I HAVE to stop.  I think this one is so much better than the sister store in West View.  I don't know why; I just like it better.  The sweetest ladies run this local bakery, and they always serve with a smile.  It's usually pretty fast too!  And they're CHEAP.  Doughnuts and giant muffins for $.65.  Cookies of all shapes and sizes are delicious and cheap as well.  It makes me so happy.  Some favorites:  All of the doughnuts:  Raised or cake, cream or jelly, chocolate or vanilla, they're ALL SO GOOD.  I wish I could stop and say no.  But I just can't.  The selection here doesn't go too fast.  I can usually still get one around lunch time, but if you want options, go early.  Lemon Poppyseed Muffin:  They run out quick, but they're so yummy!  It usually triumphs over the doughnuts.  Thumbprint cookies:  Maybe I just love the cookie, but I really like them here too!  Is the cliental a little special sometimes?  You bet.  Are the hours old fashioned early to open and early to close?  Yup.  But I just view it as absence makes the heart grow fonder.... :)
Weird place. Definitely a dive bar. Certainly dive bar customers and decor. The place is tiny with about 50% of the real estate taken over by a pool table.   Why is it so bright!? If you are gonna be a dive bar turn them things down!  With the Swizzle Inn (one of the best dive bars ever) across the street I won't be back.
Hard Rock Cafe is a cool place to go if you're in the area and want to kill time before a concert or a game, but destination bar it's not. The food is average and the drinks aren't anything out of the ordinary. Infact, there's nothing really unique about the Hard Rock aside from the fact that they jacked up the prices because you're dining and/or drinking at the HARD ROCK CAFE.   I'm disappointed that it doesn't compare to others around the world and seems out of place in Phoenix. A Hard Rock Scottsdale would be way cooler.
If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back.
This is a Beautiful Museum  The space is used well!  Like a Maze, though an easy maze as you wind through the exhibits.  The Cotton Gin was my favorite part of the museum. The Barbers chairs are cool too!  There is a Small theater also, which plays an introduction to the exhibit.
look at me...I'm standing here and i'm boring...look at me...look at me....  that seemed to be the general vibe here.  nothing special.
I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...  I love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night.   Our reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready.   Our waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:  - Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that.   -Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.  - Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.  - Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...  - Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.  So, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, “Where the hell is the waitress with our check?”   That said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)
I'm a fan of Ted's! One of my fiance's old co workers told us to check out this restaurant. We really liked it!  The people have always been friendly, and the price is unbeatable. We actually haven't been in awhile, and funny how I brought up this place again today. I'm sure we'll be going back real soon!
Clybourne is the best student bar in Champaign. Unlike most of the other campus bars, Clybourne offers a multi-floored facility, with plenty of room for sitting, drinking, and dancing. Prices are awesome! Thursdays feature $1 Coronas, Tuesdays are “Wine Nights” where they serve $8 bottles of wine and champagne. Sundays, my favorite, are $1 you-call-its. The music is always great and the place is slammed most nights of the week. I've hosted lots of parties there-- and I always get a ridiculous amount of booze for the prices I pay (also get a private room).
Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways, CLT (their main hub) is a frequent stop and I've been flying in/out of there for roughly 4 years now.  Planes usually run smoothly here no matter what section of the airport I'm flying out of.  I've gone both domestic and international without a hassle.  If you have status with US Airways the fast track on the security line is a god send.  The restaurants are good with some lively bars.  The airport itself has a very open feel to it, littered with comfortable rocking chairs should you ever want to sit a spell.  Shopping's decent if you're into that sort of thing.  It could do with more electrical outlets for the business travelers, but otherwise it's a solid place.
I miss Karsh's (no longer live in AZ), although I really like Bea's Bakery out here.  Chompies' bakery rivaled them on some items, but Karsh's made the BEST cakes.....I got one for my daughter's Bat Mitzvah.....and smaller cakes for birthdays and such.  Absolutely YUMMMMMMMMY.  Perfect cake, perfect icing.  Great challah, too.  Their other bakery items were also quite good....rugelach, hamentashen, brownies, cookies.  I'm just glad I didn't live close to them when I lived there.  Downside...they were always crowded, and I always had to wait awhile before getting served.
My boyfriend summed up our experience at Coup Des Tartes pretty well, even with the spelling and grammar issues - I swear he's college educated; he just thinks it's 'kool' to 'right' in his own unique style :)  I'm just going to add my own two cents... After reading so many great reviews of this place, we were both pretty excited to try it out.  I made our reservations online with no problem.  As he said, going on a Wednesday night was perfect - it was not too crowded and we received great service. Claire and Mona took great care of us... great ambiance and food too - To start, I went with the Roquefort Salad (their signature salad) and it was delicious! Jared was happy with his mussels appetizer as well.  They brought plenty of bread and butter for him to sop up the sauce as well - it too was fresh, moist, and yummy. Jared had the chicken entree and I had the lobster... I really enjoyed it - the lobster itself was flavorful and it also had a light sweet sauce (with coconut) that enhanced each bite.  I liked that it came with asparagus as well as a risotto.  I didn't love that the risotto had pineapple in it, but that may be just me.  We didn't need it but J twisted my arm to share a dessert... chocolate crusted cheesecake with an orange sauce and fresh berries - the perfect sweet ending to a wonderful meal!  If you like quaint, unique, local places, check out Coup Des Tartes - you won't be disappointed!
I don't know what they've done, but this place has SERIOUSLY improved their food over the past year. I was wary to try it again since the first time I went (yes, over a year ago) it was less-than mediocre. I live less than a mile away, was jonesing for indian food one day, and didn't want to drive far. I forced myself to go here and am now completely ecstatic that there's an indian food joint I can walk to, gorge myself, and roll my arse home.   The menu is standard, but somehow a little better because they offer dishes that have subtle differences. HMMM, let's see. I don't know if i'm going to describe this correctly:  Okay, I'm a vegetarian - DON'T STOP READING THIS, DAMNIT! I know what good food is!  Starting over - I'm a vegetarian, and I eat A LOT of indian food, and I have eaten at a lot of indian food places. I don't claim to be an indian foodie, but I do know that the vegetarian dishes have subtle differences so I think some places omit the dishes that are similar and just hope that people who come in order the thing that's closest to the thing they really wanted. There's one dish I always order - paneer (tikka) masala, that some places don't have so I order the closest thing to it, and of course I can't remember it right now but it's another paneer dish with a tomato base that's similar. The thing that's awesome about this place is that it has BOTH, as well as other dishes that other restaurants sometimes don't put on the menu. You know what I mean?  Who cares if you know what I mean - FOUR STARS!
Great service, but this is honestly the worst food I have ever eaten out at a restaurant in my life. I dont suggest going here for food EVER (maybe for the drink specials and hookah but nothing else).
For this pinche Gringo, this place rocks.  It's a very festive place to both shop and dine. Their food offerings through their “Cafe” or whatever they call it is endless.  It's a great spot to grab a cheap lunch. They are usually busy, so allow yourself 10-15 minutes between ordering and actually eating.  Their Agua Frescos are delicious. I recommend the Melon. It's sweetened Cantaloupe puree, served on ice. There are little melon chunkies, small enough to slurp through a straw.  Of all the food I've had there, it was good. Carnitas, carne asada gorditas, etc.  So if you want to immerse yourself in good food and some lively people take a drive down to Ranch Market....
After reading such rave reviews about this place I figured I had to check it out! The service here is fantastic! I was quickly greeted and seated. My server was also very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the vegetarian tostada and the spinach and cheese quesadilla both were delicious! The prices are very reasonable! I recommend this place if your looking for good inexpensive “comfort food”.
The staff at Urbana Tire Company have always been very friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful.  They always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they don't give you the run-around with repair costs or deadlines.  They are located close enough to downtown Urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down Main street, maybe stop by the book store, or drop into any one of the dining/drinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed.
Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town.
My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went, looked at the menu and did not find anything Portuguese on the menu. Why does this restaurant promote itself as Portuguese, fly the Portuguese flag and not have ANY Portuguese dishes. We left.
This is by far, the BEST soft serve ice cream place in southwestern PA. The “flavor of the week” is always interesting-and tasty! Though, I am somewhat disappointed that they've switched to a lower grade ice milk, for their vanilla and chocolate offerings. I don't know if this is a matter of cutting corners, or if the better stuff simply isn't available any longer. Either way, this place is still leaps and bounds ahead of DQ, Tastee Freeze, etc. It's definitely worth the trip. It's mostly street parking, though they do have about 3-4 parking spaces off to the side. Serving sizes are huge! The small cone here, is the same size as a DQ large. And the large is SO big, they can't fit it through the window-they hand it out the side door.  If you want a real “Kodak moment”-order a large cone for the kids, and keep the camera, and wet wipes handy!
got the buffet pizza was good they also give you free soup to .
Had my first visit to the Saucer a few weeks ago for a Trivia night. Beer selection is awesome and you'll find the prices reasonable too! Menu is great and this Cheesehead was very happy to see all the Brat menu items, including the Brat Nachos I started with! Had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good, though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread.  As for Trivia - they run a tight ship and it's a blast! The MC is really good and calls out all potential cheaters. Love it! I'll be back again soon when I'm in the University Area.
This place is great, only problem I had was deciding what yo eat.  You walk in and the smell of great food over comes you.  Staff was very helpful and the food was very good and lots to choose from, everyone in our party was please with their lunch.
I came through this dive while pub-crawling amongst friends. As we lined up at the bar to order beers and grub -- the bartender's muttering under her breath “oh shit.” should have tipped us off to the piss poor service that awaited us. Apparently they're not accustomed to seeing a group of ~12 people waltz in this dump. Go fig'. Mind you, we were very accommodating, and considerate of the surprise rush we created. However, when they served our table separately and completely forgot my food, I was forced to demand a refund. They're lucky I wasn't a complete a**hole and demanded the portion of the tip that I already paid toward my food order.  Sure, if you're looking for a very lonely dive all to yourself and a /few/ friends, this might be your place. But for us, it was a complete and utter disaster.  Oh, did I mention the incessant flies throughout the establishment? Yeah, not cool.
“The little hippie food market that could” seems so out of place in the “corridor of crap” that is Independence Boulevard, but I gotta tell 'ya this store is amazing for just about any special dietary need.  The star of this market is the aisle-long bulk foods section that puts anything at our other local grocery stores to shame.  Whether you need dried fruits, spices, or nuts or grains (even candies), I'm pretty sure they have it here, and also have it as an organic option.  You get as much as you need and then write the code on the side of the bag to be weighed at the checkout.  They also have just about every homeopathic remedy you could need too.  Again, you can get herbs by bulk or just about any nutrient/supplement your heart desires.  Big selection of incense and candles too.  If you have gluten allergies, this ought to be your go-to, they have a bigger selection than I have seen just about anywhere else.  Also, vegetarian/vegan friends will find a healthy supply and selection of different options here too.  They have a fresh produce section that is small, but can do in a pinch- same goes for fresh meats and frozen foods.  I'd still look elsewhere for regular shopping for these items, however.  I have to deduct a start here because the store does get a little crowded-feeling and just has the appearance of being somewhat rundown (like most of its neighboring businesses) which is far below the standard at any of the other speciality grocers in town.  Still, the store is never loaded with people and the staff is most helpful if approached.  I still don't know why they put this store where it is, but I'm not going to complain because I'm glad it's there.
This was my second visit and alas, my last.   Our first visit was at lunch and it was just OK. We weren't blown away nor were we impressed. But I will always opt to support a local Mom & Pop shop if all things are equal. This last visit was the pits.  It was 5:30pm on a Saturday night. We were one of two tables. This is usually an indication of something fishy (excuse the pun.) Appetizer was edamame. It was overcooked and left uneaten. I am not the adventurous sushi order-er; I had California rolls and spicy tuna. The tuna rolls were mostly spicy sauce then fish, very mayonnaise-y and unsatisfying. As for my CA rolls, the avocado was all brown! Not just the parts on the top (because I checked!) all the way through. When I brought it to the staff's attention her response was “Oh, yea. Avocado is like banana. They get brown very easily and we cut that yesterday.” WHAT?!? They did bring me another batch (that was part brown, part green) but it was too late. This was my first sushi restaurant EVER that we left half the rolls on the plate uneaten. Since we were all still hungry, my daughter picked up the table tent listing all the desserts. Yuck! Filthy. Not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever. When I set it back is when I noticed the wall also needed a good wipe down. Needless to say, we skipped dessert.   Our first visit deserved a 2.5 but this visit was a 1.
A ton of people told me to try this place, so I went.  It's very different than most restaurants. The place is old school, but so friendly. My pal and I had a great time! We got burgers of course. We are used to bold flavors and crazy combinations; but you will not find any of that here. They are simple burgers that have amazing taste. I repeat, do not have your hopes up for something that will dazzle you, but the quality is great. The meat was awesome, cooked to perfection. There was nothing gross about the meat, no crunchy or fatty bites.   Get the home fries.... Old school Heinz bottles where you have to hit the 57.   This place is worth trying. It seemed like a type of clientele that have been going there for years. Time for the younger hipsters to revive it?  Try it.
The entrance is hard to find/identify... the exit says Sears, but the entrance has a door that says Avis/Budget.  You have to wait in line to bring your car in for service instead of parking in the lot and going into the shop with your keys.  Waiting in line took roughly 20 minutes on a Tuesday about 12 noon.    I brought my car in for a simple oil change.. it took almost 3 hours.  Granted when they told me it was done, there were several things that Diego had found that I could fix in my car.. the list of repairs totaled over $800.  I didn't bring the car in for an inspection, just an oil change.. that's all I wanted.. could have saved time elsewhere.  It was about $40 for a high mileage oil change including tax and with a discount coupon.  They assured me that the fluids (windshield washer, power steering, etc.) would be topped off; I checked in the parking lot afterwards and it was not done.  I was so fed-up with waiting so long that I didn't feel the need to wait even more.
Not sure why this location has received so many bad reviews! I used to work directly across the street from this location and would go here for lunch AT LEAST 2 times a week. I still make it down there occasionally since i no longer work in phoenix. The owner and his wife are always so sweet and chatty, they remind me so much of my grandparents. I compare all schlotzky's to this one, and most fail in comparison.  My favorite sandwich to this day is the Albuquerque Turkey with lots of their hot sauce... now my mouth is watering... As far as “poor choice of sides” go, good luck finding a franchise sandwich shop that serves fries! I prefer chips with my sandwich anyways... anyhoo.. if you are in the area around lunch time be prepared for a line, but it goes quick! :)
The staff and the craft brew selection is great. With games, dart boards and a pool table, the KP is a great local hangout.   Linda
What?? No raw salmon? Only smoked?I am tres cornfused. Am I at a bagel place or a sushi restaurant?  Slow service. Limited sushi menu. Bland Miso.  NO RAW SALMON.  Enough said, I won't be back. Too bad it was my only Saturday sushi lunch option (Zen 32, I'm looking in your direction...).
Loooove Ide Mania! I go there mostly for waxing since I'm terrible about getting my hair cut, but I always see those getting their hair done smiling and laughing and their hair looks great. I'll be going there for this soon.   As for the waxing... Lily is AH-MAY-ZING! She's so sweet and fun, and she does the best job on waxing that I've ever had! They're quick to make appointments to fit your busy schedule and the ladies working are so friendly! You're missing out if you haven't been here yet! :)   PS - Their prices are also great! Better than any other salon I've been to WITH better service and results.
Love this beer distributor.  They always have what I'm looking for. The workers are extremely nice and always willing to help. Best one I've seen by far.
Go here for happy hour... which I believe is until 6:30pm? Great deals on drinks and the food selection isn't too shabby either.   We (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.  All of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.  Ditching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.    Couldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)
My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl, I would probably go somewhere else. But if you just want to relax in a comfortable, friendly atmosphere with some decent music, this is the place!  There were two bartenders and we happened to sit on Jeff's side. I'm sure they were both quite capable but Jeff was amazing at making us feel comfortable and chatted with us quite a bit until it got later and business picked up. Even then, he made sure we were taken care of. He's pretty much amazing and has great eyebrows.  I guess there was some craziness and fighting by the door and outside as the night got later but we never saw it and it didn't clear out the whole bar. I would expect a downtown bar to have a few problems and it seemed like they were taken care of efficiently. No strikes there.  We stuck to beers and the prices were very reasonable considering the downtown location. Apparently happy hour runs until midnight! We were able to both have some drinks on the cheap and listen some good music. Definitely returning whenever we're there again!
I went to this store 4/10/2014 and was Daniel took very good care of me upgrading my phone. I went back 4/12/2014 with my wife to return a item that was defective and upgrade my wife's phone. My wife is handicapped and had to go to the bathroom, they told her to walk over to the McDonalds which is about 100 yards away. My wife got pissed and so did I, after my wife left the store I approached  a female displeased with their flip additude. When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what.  One female and one guy felt the need to mouth off over the bathroom issue, even with a handicapped person. Of course I got pissed with their additudes and expressed my displeasure with Verizon and their wise mouths. I told them now my wife refuses to buy from that store and they said they don't really care. They then told me to leave, that they would not do the refund. I've been a customer since 1995 when it was Alltel, and then when Verison took over I stayed with Verison. When I mention this they said they really could care less. Of course being 62 and handicapped myself, I then told the female and one guy for both of them to F-OFF. The customer service has really gone down since they are the most popular wireless company in Arizona. If I can do anything to assist in taking them down a few levels I will. If Verizon continues to hire and employee people like this with absolutely no customer service professionalism, Verizon will fall like a rock. If I had not gotten my new phone 4/10/14 and now being stuck with a 2 year contract I would have jumped ship and gone with Sprint. Verizon is going to have to do a lot of butt kissing to keep me with them when the 2 years is up.
This was a surprisingly great find - the menu had plent of options, the service was outstanding with wonderful recommendations (definitely trust the waitress), and from appetizer to dessert, just a wonderful experience.
I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!
Absolutely delicious, and a very pleasant surprise.  While it seems like a little strip mall joint, it's really quite pretty inside.  The menu is extensive, and full of vegetarian options (important for me, a veggie).  We shared the ginger eggplant app to start, and then shared some veggie rolls as well. One diner got the chicken parm (oh yes...they also have Italian food...and yummy banana bread along with white rolls), two of us got only sushi, and I got the mushroom tofu dish.  Everyone cleared their plates. Very tasty, and quite affordable.  One thought - their mixed drinks, at the least the specialty ones, are really odd. I definitely won't be ordering that again. However, everything else was tasty, and we'll be back. Just don't go if you're in a hurry - service left something to be desired. Like the bill.
My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end!   Capital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: “It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.” It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to!   But I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.  Capital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!
Eh...I really WANT to like this place, but it's become a little run down over the years.  I would jump at the opportunity to go to a “true” gay sports bar, but this place just doesn't cut it.  It really needs to be about 1000 sq feet bigger to achieve the sports bar feel.  Plus they have these really old circa 1991 TV's to watch sports. (A costco run for some LCDs would go a long way here).   Beer is beer. When people play darts the place get's even smaller.  If only they would get the gay sports leaugues to commit to going there on a more regular basis...it's so hit or miss.      This place has SOOOO much potential, but it seems the owners are very happy with the status quo.
If you like crafting and sewing this is the place for you!  I needed about 6 yards of upholstery fabric as I am recovering my ratty old dining room chairs, and after some very frustrating searching through tables piled high with folded samples, old bolts and random yards, I nearly gave up then all of a sudden I found *exactly* what I was looking for: three different samples of Toile de Jouy, in pastel pink, green and blue!!  Yes!!   I was super excited to find it in all three colors.  And to add to the awesomeness of my find, my whole purchase, out the door, was only about $12.  Score!!    Be warned that this places is overflowing with fabric and sewing notions and finding exactly what you want can be a challenge, and their customer service is VERY limited.  But if you come in here with patience and lots of time to spare you will find exactly what you seek, eventually.
Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. I'm not sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm and tender, then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story.
I was walking around and decided to try this place out. I asked for a recommendation on a type of ground coffee to take home. The ladies where very helpful and knowledgable. I love the coffee. Thank you.
I went to Danny's this weekend to get an oil change and car wash and I paid for a VIP car wash.   After picking up my car I was disappointed that there was still dirt on my car floor.  I later noticed that money I had in my car for parking was missing.  I'm highly upset that I paid for these services, tipped the staff, and had my property stolen.  I've been going to Danny's on and off for years as they are close to my home but I will never frequent their establishment again.
Ok has been 7 months since my 1 star rating.  I thought I'd stop in to buy a new camcorder.  BIG MISTAKE.  One guy working in the department while the store manager and other employees talked at the customer service counter about what they watched on TV last night.  After asking 3 times for the camera guy to request some help, I gave up after waiting 40+ minutes.  I have now sworn to never go back to this store.  I have no idea how they even stay in business.
After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer.
I went here a couple weeks ago and was pleased with my cheese steak. I had it then with just the meat and cheese. Today when I returned, the guy at the counter asks, “With onions and mushrooms?” Okay, yeah. “Sweet or spicy peppers?” Spicy, please. And what I received knocked the socks off that earlier sandwich.   This place is tiny, cramped, a bit chaotic and is apparently cooled by wall-mounted fans. Yet I can see myself going here on a regular basis. So, the next time you're having one of those moments, like Ameerah A, opt for the cheese steak. Just be sure to let me know before hand so we can meet up.
Had a great time at Al Miike's this week. The Food was greatl The locals and the staff or great for company. The bartender suggested Today's Special, meatloaf, mash, and gravy. Awesome comfort food to go along with the warm welcoming locally owned and managed bar and restaurant. If you haven't been to Al Mikes, you are truly missing out on an amazing all around warm neighborhood tavern experience. Charlotte's version of Cheers... where you can feel like, “everybody knows your name.”
My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets, we just had to find a hotel room. The Renaissance Hotel is literally next door to the Byham Theatre where we had show tickets. I walked in and there was a wedding on the iconic stairs in the foyer! It was so beautiful with guests not only seated on the lobby space but also in the balconies on the second floor. I came in just as the ceremony was finishing. and when they were pronounced husband and wife, those in the balcony threw flower petals upon the couple. The hotel handled those like myself who were not part of the wedding very professionally so the ceremony would not be disturbed, but still service incoming guests.   Check in was very swift as my husband went to the restaurant to meet our dinner reservation while I checked into the hotel. I was able to take the luggage to the room and return to the restaurant a couple blocks away without even being late. I really liked the makeup mirror since I have to take off my glasses to apply my makeup.  We had dinner and enjoyed our show. We got out of the show and went to the bar for a late night bite and a drink. We got there at 10:45pm and waited and waited. At 11:04, a blonde waitress finally came to our table after delivering food to another table. We asked to see a menu, but was informed that the kitchen had closed at 11pm. We finished the drinks we had ordered, but had to pay the bartender because the waitress had left for the night. The bartender was a gentleman as I had two bills stuck together when I paid him and he found us outside to return the other one. We had to go across the street to another establishment to get something to eat.  Other than the snafu in the bar, all the staff from check in to check out were very nice and professional. The room was very clean and comfortable. As the need comes up, I will probably choose this hotel when I need to stay Downtown again. It is so close to PNC Park across the Clemente Bridge and it is in the heart of the Cultural District, so all the theaters are very close by. It is also close to public transit so you can get anywhere in Pittsburgh from that spot without having to go too far.
This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO.
New year, new clothes, time to update my closet.  A great way to sell some clothes for cash is at Buffalo Exchange.  They give you 33% for the value of the clothes or 50% for in store credit.  The staffs are so friendly.  I just love the store that doesn't smell like something died like other consignment stores.
I've driven past this place many times on the way to Suns or D-Backs games.  Every time I passed by, it looked like a fun place to go hang out.  I finally had the opportunity to do so during a conference in downtown Phoenix.  One of the companies at the conference hosted a party here.  The party was staged in the patio area as you enter the restaurant.  The company who hosted the party was giving away complimentary Cigars, so I understand why they had it outdoors.  The weather was perfect, so it was a good time of the year to do it.  The place was packed too.  So why the 2 Stars?  Here's why:  - They serve Wine out of a liquor gun....yes, they do.  When I went up to the bar on the patio and asked for a glass of Cabernet, the bartender told me “You have to go inside because we don't have the handles with the Wine”.....I thought she was kidding and I said, “I'm sorry, I don't think you understand, I asked for a glass of Cabernet.  You don't have any bottles back there?”....that's when she confirmed what I heard and said “No, you heard me right, we serve Wine out of a handle/line and since we're a smaller bar outside you have to go inside to get it”.......what the hell?!  The Wine tasted like what you would expect Wine from a tap to taste like...  - The restrooms are like gas station restrooms.  They're located out next to the bars on the patio and they are just like gas station restrooms in that they're too small and dirty.  They couldn't handle the crowd of people at the party.  - Service is slow.  The line at the bar was 30 people deep for each line (2 lines).  There were only 2 bartenders to service 200+ people.  It took 20+ min to get a drink.  - The party felt like a house party in someone's backyard.  Plastic cups, plastic furniture, you had to bus your own table.....there were no buspersons or anyone to clean up.  Bizzaro-world.....  Overall, not a good experience.  Maybe if I was a young 20 yr old it would be cool...not now.  Return Factor - 5%
BEWARE!!   I had my car serviced here. Before leaving, the Pep Boys employee who handled my payment verbally told me that my car was in good shape and had no other recommendations for maintenance, which seemed reasonable, as it was showing no signs of problems. Following the oil change, I drove home (approximately 3 miles), where the car sat for approximately one hour. I then drove from my home approximately 7 miles where the car engine was stopped for 15-20 minutes.   Shortly after starting my vehicle and driving less than 2 more miles, the engine temperature gauge spiked to the maximum and the engine began chugging. I immediately turned the car off and pulled to the side of the road, in an effort to avoid any further damage to my car. Then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town. When examining my car, the mechanics at a more trusted shop found that the radiator coolant cap was left off the fill neck and was lying on top of the engine.   Photos of the cap location were taken once the hood of the vehicle was lifted (cap was not moved by the trusted mechanic); including three images showing the coolant fill neck and the cap. The other photo showed the hood liner wet from the coolant that came out. Due to the short amount of mileage that was driven, the car thankfully became operable once radiator coolant was filled and the cap placed back on. Based on the photos and a licensed mechanic's evaluation of my car, it is apparent that the Pep Boy's mechanic removed the radiator cap from my vehicle and failed to secure it back onto the radiator fill neck. However, the store manager, Jae, informed me that since I drove my car a few miles “it must have vibrated off after service.”    I may be a female, but I know that the caps have locks, AND that I have 136K miles on this car and no cap has ever “vibrated off” while driving. Thanks for the advice. Really. I sent both photos, reciepts, and letters to Jae. He was unwilling to admit any fault. Go somewhere else for work on your car. Hopefully there are other shops are more helpful and honest.
I lived here my freshman year, and it definitely wasn't my favorite.  The rooms are big, so at first Bromley felt like a good deal.  However, I quickly learned that the walls are thin (probably just two sheets of drywall), and you can hear *every* sound from the room next door.  Even on weeknights, students often yelled and ran through the halls at 3 or 4 am.    As an engineer, I had 8:00 calculus most mornings.  So, I found it impossible to get much sleep, and I often found myself sleeping in friends' apartments, instead.  If your goal is to party constantly, this is your dorm.  If you're interested in getting some sleep, Bromley Hall is not your best bet.
Holy cinnamon all up in your face!  Cinna-cones, cinna-brooms, cinna-wreaths,  cinna-scents galore! Everything smells like cinnamon and I hate the smell of cinnamon! I even smelled like cinnamon a day after going into the store.  I burped and guess what it smelled like? CINNAMON!   Happy Holidays
Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation, but in this case, it was crap!  The smoked brisket had that discoloration that happens to meat when it's been sitting out for a while.  And it wasn't even tender!!  Am I asking for too much?
The PHX zoo is a great place to take your kids to look at large, charismatic megafauna.  However, if you are like me, you go to the zoo to try and learn something about the natural history and ecology of the animals on display.  There is very little of this, the farthest that the signage goes is to tell you the continent and maybe, if you are lucky, the country where the animal lives. The zoo is also mammal heavy. Don't get me wrong, I love a good mammal display, but I also like to see a nice collection of amphibians and reptiles.  If that is what you like to see, the PHX zoo is not the place for you.  They do have a small collection of southwestern rattlesnake and some common pet amphibians, but that is it for the herps...  They also have a komodo dragon that is pretty large but overall, they lack the fish, amphibians, and reptiles.  Also, where is the insect collections? Maybe I missed it.  The animals do have very large enclosures, but some look under kept.  Also, there is one aviary that is very cool and has some very pretty bird species.  They have red eared sliders hanging out in the ponds on the grounds that are probably the reason sliders are in natural waterways now...  a shame...  Overall, I was pretty disappointed in the PHX zoo, the admission was pricey, and the breadth of animals small.
Used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through Madison. We generally aim more for Country Inn or Hampton... but this was the best deal.  At check-in I was told they only had king beds left,  though the parking lot was quite empty.  When we got to the room there were no sheets for the hide-a-bed. We went to the front desk and asked for some. We were told that the security guard would bring them up. 45 minutes later (it was close to 12:30 am at this point) we had to call and remind them.   The room was pretty rough. Lots of ding marks on the doors and trims. The light over the mirror didn't work. Things were just worn out.  The bed had clearly seen better days.  Crowne gives you these silly “relax packs” with aroma therapy stuff.  A good bed would do more for making me relaxed.   In general I wasn't impressed.  We'll stick with Country Inn & Hampton inns.
4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.
love this place, in every way!
This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK, it was thawed, but had previously been frozen) corn, about 4 tablespoons of black beans and the same amount of feta. As a vegetarian, this salad was one of two that had some sort of substance to make one think of a meal. What a disappointment - I won't be back.
This is the first time I've had a bad experience at an Oreck store. My 6 year old sweeper suddenly began spewing dirt out. The bag wasn't close to full yet and it didnt appear anything was stuck. The sales associate without opening it up began to insist I needed a new roller brush for $40. When I showed him it looked fine to me and wouldn't that be covered by warranty, he got upset with me and began stomping around. I also showed him a warranty sticker from 2010 on the machine which stated that there was a new roller brush installed and also asked him to look up my Oreck warranty. He found my name in their system and then began shoving my sweeper at me insisting I just take it and leave then, since I obviously didn't trust him. This man was totally weird and his behavior and attitude felt very unprofessional.  I still like Oreck but do not recommend this store.
Very boring pizza, if you don't like garlic, oregano, any spices, and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you.
First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.  Also, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one.
Um...no!  Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - “made in New York City?!?!?)  I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.  Overall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.  Service was mediocre.   Moral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome.
If your a Charlotte 49'er fan, this is the place to be.  They have lot's of Charlotte memorabilia. The staff is friendly, professional and knowledgable.  We went for a Saturday afternoon lunch.  The sweet tea is VERY sweet, asked for half a glass of ice water.  I had the Southwest Chicken Salad, others had the Manhattan Pizza. My salad was fresh and flavorful. The personal pizza was excellent as well.  They also have NTN trivia if you like playing on-line.  This place probably rocks during hoops season and should be a destination once the 49'ers start their football season.  They have a hugh projection screen TV and all the requisite HD Plasamas
Oh King George, King of the Phoenix dive bars I live so close I require no cars You have pub food of plenty  And patrons a many But consuming such grease Makes me feel like a piece Your beer doesn't please me And leaves me feeling slightly queasy A dungeon of darkness With lights so dim A place void of nobles and youth Most patrons barely have more than a tooth My visits here leave me full of sorrow I guess see you again tomorrow....
I love this place and my kids love this place.  We have been members for years.  The best part is this membership gets us into other museums throughout the US for free or for a big discount.
I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived, I was impressed. The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P
They lost my clothes and three weeks later they still had not resolved the problem.  The manager was supposed to call me but didn't until I showed up in person and insisted.  Their idea of resolving the problem was waiting to see if they ever turned up on their own. Scary when their response was “what we usually do in this situation...”  They lose clothes that often?!?!    What clothes they did return were either wrinkled or stiff as cardboard (I requested light starch).  One pair of pants were torn.  If you value your clothes, do not use this incredibly unprofessional business. Go to American Cleaners instead.  They are friendly, professional and very well priced.
We had to rush in and rush out. So we got what we wanted. Great service, great menu, and accommodating. Having only been here once so far, we'll go again.
Sorry, but I stopped in this morning to get my lunch because I knew I would be too busy to go out for lunch.  Got a Greek Salad.  First of all, there was no lid on the salad, it was wrapped in plastic wrap... What??? Anybody could put anything in there without too much trouble.  Second when I went to eat it, I threw most of it away because the lettuce was brown and/or wilted.  Not going back again.  I didn't spend all that money for garbage.
Well kept secret in University City. Took the kids for a day out. Very affordable prices. $5 for each game per person. 25 cents for the video games. Throwback video games (Pac-Man, Moon Patrol, Donkey Kong, Foosball, Air Hockey). 9 holes of the putt-putt are above ground, the back 9 are underground. The kids thought it was pretty cool. Great spot to get to if you want to get out with the kids or have a date night out with the missus. A+++++ Now that's what's up!!!!
...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.
ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home, but when the floors were ripped up, the water mitigator said we had a problem with our dishwasher and needed to have it checked for leaks.  My home warranty company gave me the number to Carolina Appliance Service.  I left a message and got a call back right away.  When I told the guy my situation, he stopped me and said he was NOT interested in working with me because he was worried that if he did a bad job the insurance company would be coming after him.  He actually started an argument with me.  I assume he was the owner because he said “my company”.  But my simple question was 'Isn't that what you do?  Fix dishwashers?'...why is this company even on my home warranty's list of providers.  He argues so much that I didn't even get to tell him this wasn't part of an insurance claim.  So to recap...very rude, with obviously NO CONFIDENCE in his own work.  Don't call these guys.
Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)
I have been here multiple times for all facets of dinning including lunch, dinner, drinks, late night bites and a corporate function and everytime i've liked it. It is one of my favorite places to go before a baseball or basketball game. They have a great selection of handcrafed beers both on tap and in bottles. There food is also really good for what i take as more of a bar enviornment. There burgers, sandwiches and pastas are all well executed and have a gourmet flair with resonable prices. The lobster bisque is fantastic, and so are the salads and appetizers. They have a great patio downstairs and a balcony where you can eat and drink outside upstairs too. Check this place out it is more than worth the visit, and they have good happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.
Walked over before a dbacks game. Loved the beer garden, nice draft selection and good tunes. It will likely become tradition before future games.
Have stayed here before and very much like this hotel and its location.  Superb value.  They have done a lot of remodeling and still are working on a few of the final touches, when complete this is going to be a super nice property.  One thing that caught my attention and I think is really cool is the pool is 10 feet deep on the deep end.  When is the last time you saw something like that?  Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to fear of drowning liability.  I am a huge fan of deep pools and rare they are to find.  So for me that is another nice feature to this property.  It is in a quiet area of town and lots of neat things around to do.. just 3 miles from Camel Back Drive and tons to do on that road.. The surrounding beauty makes this property even nicer if you find flaws which every hotel will have.
Went here just before a movie. The service was fast but that's it. I ordered the mango and shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered nachos. The food was not good. I and my friend could not finish our food and we had stomach aches immediately after.
We LOVE the AZ Science Center so much that we recently became members and plan to go often. We love the exhibits and the fact that they change out the special exhibits often. I do recommend packing a lunch as the cafe is a bit pricey, but the food is good.
Shits poppin. Would give five stars but lids on to-go cups are a little iffy. Also damn how many characters do I need to type for this to be a review, the world needs to hear my voice fam
Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers, I liked the dress of the servers and the decor of the place was pretty cool.  I sat in a booth by myself and was immediately greeted by the server with a menu.  I ordered a Green Tea Sake...SOOO GOOD!  It came in a little glass bottle and it called Sake2Me.  I plan to buy it!  As I enjoyed my sake, I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings.  Totally not what I expected...two roll-like, dough things came out and it tasted like it looked...just like raw dough stuffed with lots of crunchy lettuce-like pieces and tiny chopped meat.  I didn't see any shrimp, not even mini shrimp.  I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said “You don't like your shrimp dumpling?” I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except “I want to have room for my Pad Thai”.  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.  The Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.  I'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says “dumpling”.
This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area.
Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice.
Hands down the most disrespectful and terrible lounge in pittsburgh. Appalling  service, I went there with 6 people, restaurant was empty and sat there for twenty minutes with staff walking by. The lounge was empty, was there from 8-11 she didn't check on us once, we had to flag her down , complained to the manager with no response. NYC prices as well, very embarrassed for the big burrito company.
Good food at the right prise. The wait staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. Enjoy the night and eat outside!
I was across the street for a Dr appointment and decided to step into the AJs after to browse since it was “right there”. Haven't been into one in years for the same reason that I probably won't return after the recent visit: way overpriced for things I can buy elsewhere. Almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store, and pay less for it. They do carry a small number of “gourmet” items on the shelves, but I can find those other places, too.   So, you'd think that their deli or bakery or something would stand out, but not that I can tell. I was going to try something from the bakery case but it was all way overpriced and totally unimpressive looking. I was there in the AM so I did try a slice of the breakfast pizza that was out in the deli. First off, it took me several minutes to be served because the staff was busily ignoring me. Then when I did finally get my slice, I went to pay and eat it, and the thing was cold and chewy. The crust was just so tough. The eggs were somewhat dried out. I was seriously underwhelmed.   The store was practically dead the whole time I was wandering around. The staff outnumbered the patrons BY FAR. How do these places stay in business? You won't get more money from me AJ's!
I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.  Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.  My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is value here.
I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab mix named Lily. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was told she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals. She gets along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't take great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in awful condition, and she was too skinny. We were ready to give her back because of the strain it put us through. We have since turned her around with training and gotten her back to full health, but it took hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
So good!!! We went as a group and everyone loved the food they ordered.  The food was very reasonably priced!! Yum!
The other reviews are right on. This place is so weird and sketchy I would never send my wife here. The inside looks like a great place to get murdered. I prefer to sit outside thinking about which direction I'd run if shit goes down. But the people are nice and they do a thorough job on the car for a good price. BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE CASH!
Tram has great Pho, and enough of it to feed all of Pittsburgh when the next fake Armageddon rolls around.
Not sure what is happening, but two visits and two messed up orders.  Both times it took them more than an hour and half to prepare our pizza.  The first time they apologized for the “slow service” and the fessed up that they lost our order.  Six weeks latter - they DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN. Not only did they lose our order, but then when we got home they gave us the wrong salad order.  Their pizza is not good enough to justify this type of wait.  We will look for another pizza place that manages their orders better.
I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.  I do anesthesia for a living and if I performed this incompetently I would get my ass sued off for sure and I would deserve it.  I guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax, and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than I do evidently by what they charged.  Humans don't even get charged this much for simple IV therapy!  Totally ridiculous, take your dog, cat, parrot whatever to the U of I, they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave.  This place is a joke to the highest magnitude!
Excellent service. They were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers. Of course it is pricey but it is worth it. Food was excellent.
The only reason they dont get 1 star is because I understand they aren't accustomed to the heavier side of music and prolly panicked a bit when the Bad Brains came through.  that said, this place bites. 1. They blocked off half the seating, oversold the show, and then were kicking people out for standing. 2. It was a punk rock show following an AM skate competition. They were cutting people off that werent anywhere close to obliterated.  3. the bathroom situation is chaos. 4. the bouncers who usually work shows like Barry Manalow were acting like they were Hell's Angels roughing up little kids trying to mosh and in the end pissed off the band. 5. just to get into the place required every punk kid to remove every last bit of metal.  Their punk kids man.  thats a lot of studs, chains, piercings, etc. What a hassle.  Im sure its a great place to go see Celine Dion acoustic or something equally lame.  But why a place like that would book heavier stuff and then react like that is beyond me. I felt like i was in jail. Only in jail the bathtub gin is cheaper and you dont get yelled at as bad for smoking too close to a doorway.
Lots of fun, little bit of cash.   These games are great for getting a bit of fresh air, hanging with a few friends, drinking a(few) brews, and munching on some ballpark goodies. VERY family friendly, but still fun for those of us who don't know who the hell the Jonas Brothers are.   I personally have never been in the Duck Blind, but I hear it's over-rated.  Bring sunscreen if you're on the third-base line!!!
If you're on Twitter you'll see so many different places you can follow. Its cool to because they announce deals and such that are coming soon. For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, “oh yeah sure”. What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing.   Anyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door.   At the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't. Very misleading, the classic bait and switch apparently still works.
LOVE THIS PLACE!!! its a little over priced though which suck especially if you're a student as I am. This place is close to campus so you'd think they'd offer some kind of student discount, buuuuuuut the do NOT! its 18 bucks to go in and I love going here because I am a photographer but that adds up after awhile
While there were no insect carcasses in my food, I was still not very impressed with my meal at PF Chang's.  I went for a “business lunch” with my boss.  Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!  I got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like.   Because I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.
I live in walking distance to this place and wished it was all that and a bag of chips. Really people FIVE STARS???? seriously concerned  for where those people normally eat. This place is not even average. We have tried it 2X and just wont do it again. To be honest i cant remember what we had both times but a pasta dish was one thing and a meatball sub?? not sure. Pass on this one and go up the street to La Fontanella for a much better meal.
In theory, Tessaro's is exactly what you want -- a casual neighborhood joint in a great location with an acclaimed product. In practice, it's not very pleasant to go there. I don't think they want us there. Every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward.  The burger itself  -- the actual cooked meat -- is indeed good, but they have no interest in all the other stuff that turns cooked meat into a hamburger experience.  The buns are poor quality; they absorb juices and toppings so they get sloppy and disgusting after a few bites. The burger just falls apart in your hands (or onto your lap). You have to finish it with a fork.    They don't serve French fries, and they seem affronted when you ask for some.  This is a bizarre, given that everything else about the place screams “we have fries here!” Why withhold fries from customers who surely have been asking for them every day for years? This hints at either a weird purist dogmatic sensibility, or deliberate sabotage.  Why not serve fries *and* homefries?  Are they afraid the fries will win, exposing the hollow sham that the homefries have been all along?  I've come to believe that everyone at Tessaro's is under a spell where they must cook and serve excellent hamburgers, but they hate cooking and serving hamburgers. Everything about the restaurant that is not an actual meat patty is cleverly designed to keep you away. But you  keep going back.   Have some pity for the poor cursed Tessaro workers, and just go up the street to BRGR, or downtown to Winghart's.
Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered “fresh” which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.  My husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.    We'll return.
First things First...   LOCATION:   Camelback Barber Shop is not easy to find if you don't know where you're going. It's located in the Camelback Colonnade shopping center. More specifically, it's in the alley between the Hallmark store and ULTA, which even More specifically, are located next to Michaels Craft store. If you don't find it with those instructions... I can't help you.  The rest of the story:  Prior to today, I've had one haircut in Phoenix. It was in Arcadia and the place was okay, but I just wasn't feeling it. A lot of the places I found in the Arcadia/Biltmore area were just too hoity toity based on the pics I saw. And pricey. Then I noticed some of my Yelp Phx compadres had been to this Camelback Barber Shop. All of them with good things to say.   I walked in and it definitely isn't pretentious by any definition of the word. If you want eye candy or upscale, this is not the place for you. I think it was very comfortable. My barber Alex was friendly. We made some small talk, including comments about the episode of Pawn Stars that was playing on TV. I can't stand that show...  Television show preferences aside though, I would like to say that I have found my new barber shop! The cut I got here was better than the previous And it cost a little less. I actually think Alex may have done the cleanest and most detailed straight razor work that I've ever had. I look dapper.
We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service.   As for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat.   To top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there.   Eating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon
Had a rare only person in the house night, so I decided to treat myself.     I have passed by the Panda for years, and have always wanted to stop by, but my wife is very picky about Chinese food.   With only me, I had the perfect opportunity.  I stopped in on the way home on Tuesday, July 3rd, to order and go.   Entered, and found really nothing to write home about the interior decor.  But I am of the mindset that if the decor is not great, the food usually is.  (long experiences with Mexican restaurants in the west)  There were several people in the front area, either waiting for their food or waiting to order.  But nobody sitting down.  It was early in the evening, though.  I love General Tso's chicken, and most of the time, it is not that spicy, to appeal to a wider audience.   I ordered the dinner special, which came with fried rice and an egg roll.   I could see thru to the kitchen behind the counter, and was able to watch as my food was prepared.  It came quickly, and I took it home.  As I was leaving, there were more people coming in.  I got home and grabbed a beer, and got into my order.  And the General Tso's was spicy!!!  The way it should be!!  It was a generous portion, and the fried rice was flavorful.  The egg roll, well it was an egg roll, but I love egg rolls as well!  Be mindful, this was just a review of one dish.  I do have to go back and try more!
I completely agree with Chris S. Happy pills. Seriously. EVERYONE at this hospital is SO NICE!!! The nurses, the doctors, all of the staff....day and night. My friend is being treated here and has been addmited for various days now, and everyone agrees this hospital has really made this whole situation so much more bearable and less stressful, considering.   When you or a friend is going through illness or trauma, the last thing you want to deal with is rude and uncaring nurses and doctors. You will NOT experience that here....they are WONDERFUL.  The hospital itself is very nice, it feels modern and clean. There is even a nice “healing garden” you or patients can relax and get a little fresh air in. The food isn't that bad considering this is a hospital...I had a nice salad and sweet potato fries one day! Prices are like an airport.....expensive. But at least it's not typical cafeteria food.  Thank you Good Sam for taking such good care of my friend!
Rented space here for a couple years. Clean and convenient central Phx location. Great staff. Would highly recommend.
I like their variety in products, however they always have peddlers there asking for money and making people uncomfortable, but they don't seem to do anything about it.  Also almost every single time I go to the pharmacy, they never have my prescription ready, even after they've called me to tell me it was ready. One day I called it in about 3 days early, just to make sure I could stop by anytime before I ran out to pick up my prescription.It turned out I wasn't able to pick it up until the day that I ran out anyway, and even though I had called in three days earlier, it still wasn't ready! To add to this frustration, I have gone in and waited for up to 3 hours for prescription to be ready, when I was told it would only take 15 to 30 minutes. Lastly, they have the automatic prescription refill, when they call you to tell you that it's ready when your prescription runs out. I signed up for this, however they didn't call me the last time I had a refillb ready because they weren't aware it needed to be refilled, and the time before that they called me to tell me it was ready and when I showed up it wasn't ready. I'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions. I am taking my business elsewhere.
The portions are huge and the wait time is rather long.  It's always an annoying comfort when you have to wait a hour to get seated.  It means you've chosen the right place to eat and that seemingly everyone else in the city has chosen the same place.  The food isn't exactly unique, but the price is definitely a steal.  My Western omelette lasted me 3 consecutive meals.  Their hash brown mash must have an addictive additive mixed in with it's goodness because I can't seem to stop scooping those potatoes into my mouth.  Go, my fellow Charlotteans!  It'll be worth the wait and kind to your wallets.
This is the place to be in Charlotte. I am a nighttime gym-goer, and I needed a gym with late night hours. The Dowd is open until 10 during the week, which while I would prefer 11, works for me. Also, going at non-peak hours saves me from the parking and crowding issues that others seem to face- ain't no crowds at 9:30 pm! I generally stay in the Women's Fitness Center, which is a gym inside itself, but every now and then I'll make it upstairs. The desk staff is always friendly, and there are plenty of amenities to utilize. The one area I haven't ventured into yet are the group exercise, mainly for scheduling reasons, but I am eager to sneak into one one day.
I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
Great little airport. Now direct connection to Europe. Live piano music in terminal. Us airways hub. Rental car shuttles run every few minutes. Lots of charging stations for electronic devices. Airport is also small enough to make transfers easy.
Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality.
Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.  For a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister.
The hours are wrong for Sunday. Beware. The food is wonderful but yelp is posting the wrong hours on Sundays. I'm here at 7pm and this amazing restaurant is closed. I am sad
This place is the real stuff. Just moved from portland OR. and its the only place that reminds me of home. Great food, great drinks, and great peeps. If you really wont to experience Bloomfield to its fullest, two words.......Sunday Funday. Check it out and you wont be disappointed. #gopitt
Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good, but not at that price and if I would've been told it was that much (was a special) I would've passed. Service was fine, but not attentive and slow, as well. Just so many other good Italian places in the area for half the price. Eggplant parm was enjoyable.
Food was great, generous portions, they piled on the entrees, despite the to go box already pretty full. Good to see. Didn't see any old lady maybe that's why.
This is one of those hidden hot spots in Phoenix that people don't know about, but should. The beer is excellent and the service was top notch. Really I would give this place a 4 1/2. Boyfriend and I both had burgers, which were meaty and juicy without being greasy. I ordered the beer sampler, which was a great choice for a first timer. Overall this place is great!!
My friend and I decided to try out TGI Fridays for a beer during the baseball game to get a bigger bang for our buck. For what we would pay for a small hot dog and 20 oz beer, we could get a great meal, larger beers, and great service, right?! Wrong.   The restaurant was not very crowded for a game night, yet we were denied a table overlooking the stadium. Twice. The manager asked us to visit the hostess stand to get a table, but they informed us there was a wait. NO ONE WAS IN LINE FOR THE RESTAURANT!   I had to get our own menus from the bar, after playing “let's avoid making eye contact, and maybe she will go away.” After we ordered, three sets of people were sat in the tables we were waiting for, and their meals came out before our order!   Our waiter ended up offering us a free beer for the late arrival of our food, and ended up comping our entire check, but that will be my last visit “Front Row.”   I'd rather pay $10 for a beer and $8 for a processed hot dog than to get snobbed by anyone in the service industry. All I wanted was a good time after a work day from hell, and to enjoy a Diamondbacks game ...
Totally enjoyed my experience with Craig at Uptown Retreat.  All of the staff were very friendly and eager to help.  My friend and I were both in from out of town and scheduled two blow outs and one cut.  Craig was my stylist and Davis did my friends hair.  Both guys did an excellent job!  Craig you 'get it'....hair length, face shape, hair cut, and most importantly the blow out and style!  Not many stylists can bring it all together like you did! Thank you..now will you please come to my town!?!?  Oh...and I loved the corner location of your chair....had an awesome view while getting my hair did! :-)
Been trying for 30 mins on and off to order a delivery. I get voice mail and nothing else.
Since I have promised myself that I'm not allowed to move away from Charlotte until I have eaten at every restaurant, I figured that Restaurant Week would be a perfect time to visit Luce, a small Uptown spot that has been on my list for years.  Upon arrival, our table wasn't quiet ready.  No problem there, because the suggestion to “grab a drink at the bar” was a given.  Tucked away in the corner, the attentive bar-goddess quickly poured us wine and presented us with nibbles.  Super-crunchy potato chips (which appeared to be made in house), as well as a heaping handful of olives were placed in front of us.    These. Olives.    I wanted to fall asleep in a bowl if these olives.  I don't know what kind of magic the cooks/aka/olive-wizards behind the scenes of the closed kitchen put into them (fresh garlic? fresh rosemary? tears of their first born?), but I'm talking LIFE CHANGING. Like little baby angels.    The food was great, service attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back....for the olives.
I have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  Today I tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  I called to talk with the Manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  Which I guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  There are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.
I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here, wife and I sat at the bar and people watched over some WELL POURED drinks.   Strong point.  Then we screwed up and ordered food.   I got their infamous lobster roll.  Glad I had a drink.  Overcooked and dry, dry, dry. I thought lobster roll was generally made with a lobster salad-like mix.  This lobster was dry and chewy.  Lots of it, though  I guess that accounts for the high price.   I went down to Wholeys and got a much tastier one for 5 bucks.  And wife's nachos were just a big pile of chips with some toppings thrown on the top.  Then the other day,  we went back and I tried pizza.  Yuck.  The toppings were terrible (pepperoni, sausage.  how can youscrew that up, but they did.)  Two slices and boxed it up so as not to hurt the waitress' feelings.  But it went into the trashcan down the street.  Go for the hootch and not the food!!
Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there.
Used a Groupon special for the Murder Mystery evening with tickets to the show and dinner. The Murder Mystery show was in a room about 20 x 30 feet with 50 people crowded into this space. The volume of the music and announcements were so loud, we couldn't even talk to half the people at out table! They took our drink order and we didn't see it until half an hour later. The food was HORRIBLE! How can you ruin a spaghetti dinner??First of all, it was cold! Cold spaghetti !! Hardly any sauce! The house salad was taken out of a plastic bag and dumped into a bowl....at an Italian place, they served the salad with only ranch dressing ..... Not even Italian! And no choices offered.  Our party of four will NOT go back. At least 10 others felt the same way.
Pizza has a great flavor and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce has Great Flavor, only too little sauce!  If you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot!  The service here is always very good!  I have to say I'm a fan because I eat here more than any Italian place!
No complaints about this place. I tend to gravitate towards this place mid afternoon with my laptop...love the vibe here. Outdoor patio or, NICE window seating upstairs. Creative menu as well. Check it out!
Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!
Will never come here again!  My cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed, so we drove 30 minutes in the opposite direction to this location in Huntersville.  When we walked in around 10PM on a Friday, the place was packed to the brim. All the exam rooms were full and there were about 10 people in the lobby. Okay, so maybe that night we just had bad luck?  No. Our greeting at the front desk was awful. The secretary didn't even make eye contact with us and acted like we were inconveniencing her. She was appalling and rude.   We were told we would have to wait at least an hour because they were overly busy, which we understood. After a couple hours, we asked if we could just check our sick kitty into the ICU for the night and leave because we knew she needed overnight supervision.  Well, the secretary didn't even come relay the NO response to us.  Luckily, not all of the staff were as dreadful as the secretary. But we ended up waiting over 5 hours (until 3:30AM), only to be told that they were admitting her into the ICU overnight and running tests (exactly as we requested before). I know the protocol was to have the doctor chat a moment in person before we left, but we felt that common sense wasn't being put to use at this facility.
Decent!
Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes, and the polish smudged because it was slopped on so thick it never would have dried.   As she was polishing my nails, I was thinking, “Man, that is way too thick!  It'll never dry!”, but I didn't say anything because I thought maybe she had some super topcoat that would make the impossible possible.  Well, she didn't, and the polish stayed not just tacky, but downright WET for 4 hours, before I finally just SCRAPED the goop off and painted them myself.    I will never be back, and wish I had saved my $30 (I had a Groupon) and my $15 tip.  Should have just done them myself.
This is a better than average- let's say very solid-  sushi restaurant.    We had the omakase and had some delicious bite sized courses.  But strangely the little bites never added up to feeling super full (which could be a good thing, but devouring a chocolate pretzel dessert isn't really the perfect end to omakase).    The miso black cod was excellent, the sashimi was well executed, and clearly the chef had many, many years of traditional sushi training.  But for some reason my socks just weren't blown off.  More sushi and sashimi could have done the trick.  On the other hand the desserts were delicious and memorable (which come from the restaurant downstairs- Soba).  Great atmosphere, attentive service and will def. go back.  At the same time, I'm open to finding alternatives in Pittsburgh (too optimistic?)  And Dr. Freddie Fu is a fan (see autographed picture on sushi bar).  Not sure what this means, but maybe if I return I will be further enlightened.
So Domino's is Domino's, right?  You must know what you are getting--I don't have to tell you the pizza, breadsticks, chicken strips, pretty good in terms of getting what you pay for.  However, this location gets the unfortunate privilege  of being my neighborhood locations (less than a mile from my house), and although this location has been prompt and delicious, this is more a review about the man himself, Mr. Domino and my online ordering experiences with him.  My friends, why would you spend $17 on a Domino's pizza when Papa John's will give it to you for $11?.  Not to say I'm a broke hobo, but seriously, the difference in cost is a draft beer at a classy joint and 2 at the places I frequent.  My biggest irk with Domino's is that they advertise $11.99 Any Speciality Pizza and if you change 1 item, say you don't like mushrooms (not saying that's me, could be, not saying) and trade for something like black olives (even trade, no?  Sometimes I even end up with less on the pizza because I don't like meats all that much and substitute veggies).  So if you change 1 item instead of their $11.99 advertised special, all of a sudden the price is $16.99?  $5 for some f''in black olives?  Seriously.  I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!  About the 3rd time this happened I finally put my foot down and looked up Papa John's website.  $11 any pizza, up to 7 toppings, any toppings.  Pretty much my BFF.  PJ's.  Go for it.
I'm really trying to branch out more into Uptown...ye though I walk through the valley of death...oops, I digress.  The Hubbs and I had a guest in town and he suggested we eat here.  I happened to take a chance on this place, without consulting Yelp, and I have to say I'm glad I *again* (see Golden Taipei) went out on blind faith!!!  I got the Ravioli Pecca-something-Italian-sounding and it was tasty!  Had those cute, broccoli and sun-dried tomatoes...mmm mmm!  My husband got some sort of roast beef sammie and the meat was cooked au jus. Needless to say, he was full and happy and our guest joyfully guzzled down some chicken wings (because apparently, where he lives in West bumble-**** Virginia no one makes chicken wings?! But, that's another blasphemy for another day).  What makes me a fan is the fully-loaded bar and drink selection.  Our waitress made a wonderful recommendation based off of how I was feeling (Libra Love: Crown Royal, Malibu Rum, Pineapple juice, and raspberry something-or-other...can you tell it worked?) and I appreciated how she kept the rounds coming (our guest enjoyed Jack & Coke).  The atmosphere was pretty chill and they can cater to larger parties, so I'm already thinking about some type of girls night outing including Presto!  This would also be a great date night spot (reserved for pay day weekends)
I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria.
I just moved to the area and went here for the first time the other day. Tomaso did a great job! I high recommend this place.
Watched a Suns game here recently and had a blast.  The arena is in the heart of Downtown Phoenix and is near bars and restaurants.  It's really easy to have a pre and post-game party.  We walked to Lucky Strikes after the game and had a few drinks and shot some pool.  Overall, it's a good time in this arena.  Return Factor - 90%
I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.  Check in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge.   One odd note, you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so, take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.  The restaurant attached to the hotel, a lovely, fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket, is slated to close at the end of October, 2014...in it's place is going to be a restaurant called “Bill's Burgers & Grill” I hear it is good, but we shall see next time I stay here.  There is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel.
Thoroughly impressed with this airport.   Not that I'm some great world traveler, but all the more reason.  See, when I booked my virgin transatlantic flight (yes, virgin with a lower case v--as in, I was popping my passport cherry; not capital V, as in going on the airline), I needed an airport that wouldn't drive me batty with traffic.  As fun as it would have been to fly through a big name airport like JFK or LaGuardia, I think I might have regretted it.  In fact, on the return leg, I was even more grateful.    Being a noob, I took to the interweb for advice.  I had read in some online travel blog about how I should book 3 hours between connecting flights for the first stop back on US soil to get through customs, get to the new plane, blah, blah, blah.  I read that Charlotte was well organized. My flight only gave me two hours and change BUT there was a later one on the same airline to the same destination if I should happen to miss my connection.  So I felt okay about it.   When we touched down on US soil, the flight attendants made an announcement that a Lufthansa flight had also just touched down and that their plane was MUCH larger than ours and that we should head the heck out ASAP if we have connections to get. Panicked, we all made a run for it to customs but were too late.  Stupid Lufthansa people.  As we stood sulking in line, we realized how quickly the line was moving.  Customs agents throughout the room made sure that travelers were in the correct customs lines (“US and Canadian passengers ONLY on the LEFT--EVERYONE ELSE ON THE RIGHT”).  They came through the line to make sure everyone in line had their documents and KEPT THEM OUT instead of tucking them in some side pocket of some suitcase somewhere only to waste time fumbling for it later. Finally, they segregated people into mini-lines for customs agents to be screened.  All told, we stood in line (behind Lufthansa even!) for just 15 minutes. Take that JFK.    I might even add that unlike most airport staff, the folks here even seemed to be a bit friendlier.  Customs agents smiled and played with babies.  Volunteers standing in corridors handed us free luggage tags.  Airports of the world could take a lesson from Charlotte-Douglas, I think...
Staying as airline crew at the Sheraton hotel across the street, I asked the front desk person to recommend me a good Mexican restaurant.  He recommended the “Canyon Caf\u00e9” which is in the same exact mall/movie complex as this place, “Mi Amigo's “ .  I reviewed the Canyon Caf\u00e9's menu and didn't care for it since it's more of a Fusion restaurant, not real Mexican food.  I told the hostess that I wanted more authentic food and she told me to try “Mi Amigo's” . I walked 100 feet to this place.  I have to say the server was a sweetheart...very friendly, welcoming - THAT's the ONLY thing I liked about this place, aside from the Cadillac Margarita for $5.75.  I ordered the tortilla soup.  OKish; free chips and salsa - the chips were awesome, the salsa mediocre.  The worst disappointment was my main course - I ordered the Red Beef Tamales.  These are the worst tamales that I remember eating.  I can make them better myself at home!! And I am an awful cook!  I was joined by one of our flight attendants and he joined me at my table.  He pretty much reached the same concensus as I.  Sorry, but I really, really was looking forward to a nice, hot tasty Mexican meal.  I was in Arizona for crying out loud, not in North Dakota or Maine, where Mexican food may not be as widespread.   PLEASE get your menu and most importantly your ingredients in order!  My colleagues at my airline stay across the street at the Sheraton and would appreciate a nice Mexican meal on our work trips.   Thanks !!
Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .  I think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  The service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No “how's it going”, no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink.   The portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.  The atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.  The waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?  Other reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.  Jews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're “busy”, can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?  The slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?  Only go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.
I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be “homemade” but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated.
overpriced for “beep-beep-beep” everything, but some of the table jukeboxes work!  --omelet was too perfectly formed to be freshly made, ew. where did it come from? --they must have silenced the microwaves, or the beeping from the “kitchen” would have drowned out the music. --not much food prepared here, just reheat, serve, and charge a bundle for it  The recent availability of mostly-ready-to-serve food provided by Shamrock and its local competitors is mostly just scary. Don't have a grill? No problem, we can make your eggs benedict for you, almost-ready-to-serve. No toaster? No problem. We can deliver it pre-toasted. [stepping down...ok i'm done now]  I loved being able to select diner tunes from the table's mini-juke. It worked too! Note: some of the tables' jukes are possessed by demons and may suddenly start, or not work at all. Take your chances when dropping your two-bits.  I love the vibe, just not the food. Unfortunately, that's what I go to a restaurant for, THE FOOD.
Finally doing a review after visiting Arriba's for years. This past stay stuck with the Chimichanga with Machaca beef covered in Green Sauce. Loved it! Over the years got the Posole (since I have a Posole addiction); but I resisted this time. If you like spicy head to Arriba's. They also have great margaritas, had the mango margarita. Will be back again!
A Phoenix native told me I had to try the mexican food while I was in town, so I stopped by La Tolteca and I was happy I did.  I tired out a torta and a couple of sopas.  The al pastor sopa was right on as was the the carne asada.  My milanesa torta was a bit chewy but otherwise prepared with great fresh veggies.  Hit up the salsa bar for some extra flavor!  Enjoy!
I ate here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  The wine bar is not exactly in the same building but is a few feet out of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  The wine bar was bursting at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not move much past the door.  Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able to see a beautiful bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.  The main dining dining room was nothing special in my opinion as there was nothing that I can remember that really stuck out.  Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  It came out six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty good.  For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  It also tasted wonderful and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy things and consisted of spicy salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  Once again the colors were nice and I absolutely loved the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy with the service.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here in the future.  The food was fantastic and not as expensive as I had expected while the service was good.  I would recommend that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid the large crowd that we ran into.
This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed, but absolutely terrible.  Not that we ate the food, because we never had a chance.  We were seated immediately in an area with another table that was served by our server.  There were only two tables taken in the restaurant and our server took 10+ minutes to bring us drinks.  Still waiting on our drinks, our appetizer came out with no silverware, no plates, still no drinks.  Our server came by (we had already asked him about the drinks once).  Shortly thereafter, he brought the drinks, still no plates and no silverware.  We waited a few more minutes and he brought out our salads.  Still no plates and no silverware.  When we asked again about the plates, he laughed as though we had made some strange request.  We continued to wait - no chopsticks, no silverware, no plates - after it became too ridiculous to handle we got up and walked out  It's the only place that we've ever done that before - and we have had some terrible service.  The food that we stared at looked terrible - in hindsight I'm glad that we had no utensils.  If you have an hour to kill, are looking for terrible service, aren't in a rush, and want to order some food that looks disgusting you may want to check it out; otherwise, stay away!
Actually to the last reviewer, yes they do run on a rigid schedule here, if your even 5 minutes late your skipped and have to reschedule. I've been with uw system now for about 2 yrs since my employers plan switched us from Dean.  And I have to say I miss dean so much. Better service, friendlier doctors, the list goes on. This opinion also applies to most of their clinics ( urgent care, optometry, psychology, hospital/ER)
When I want to go out but not spend $100 on entertainment and also get some exercise in at the same time and see some beautiful Arizona landscape, the Desert Botanical Gardens is the best place I can go. I enjoy walking around the Garden looking at all of the flowers in bloom and all of the different kinds of cactus. I also enjoy when they have different exhibits that you can see as you are wandering the garden. I really enjoyed the Chihuly Glass artwork that was displayed a few years back.   Probably my favorite time of the year to come here is when they have the butterflies. They are so pretty and this year there were so many of them! We went this last weekend on my day off and the weather was perfect and we just had a great time. I also get to brush up on my photography skills here the best because I can take some amazing pictures of flowers and butterflies.   If you want to see what the Arizona desert is all about, you need to come here to experience it first hand. Its not only about dirt and cacti. There are flowers galore as well.
Summer time is supposed to be “healthy time”, so I am trying to watch what I eat. Now, I will always be a big guy (not “two fat twins on their matching motorcycles” big, but you know, not little) but I definitely am eating more appropriately. However, I work in an office, and around 11:30, people start to double-think their lunch choices. Yes, the night before, a breakfast bowl from Jimmy Dean sounds like an excellent lunch selection, but all that pushing of buttons and watching your meal spin in the microwave? Forget it; one “What are you doing for lunch” from a buddy and I was out of there.  Athenian was a prime lunch spot for me for awhile, and just fell out of favor. No time like the present to return, plus SB had never been there before today. We took the 2 minute drive to Central and rolled in to a 1/3 filled Athenian Express. Happy to have missed the rush, I immediately ordered my favorite dish, the gyro feta (no tomatoes/onions, add lettuce) with fries, and SB got a chicken sub and potato salad.  First issue, no fountain soda? If I can't destroy myself with aspartame in my free refills, it's not a great lunch. Plus, I don't like drinking out of cans unless its a more adult beverage. Fix yo machine, Athenian!  Outside of the $1.50 soda, the meal was as good as always. It was a bit lighter on the feta than usual (and LOVE me some feta goodness), but still had quite a pile. The meat was thick and cooked through, definitely filled up the pita to an overflowing Greek party. The french fries weren't overcooked, which is good because burned fries suck fully. Add in a side of tzatziki sauce to poor over everything, and times were well spent. It's a ton of food for what you pay, and one of the best deals downtown.  My coworker didn't fair quite as well, but it was more his preferences than issues with the meal. His chicken sub came with a huge breast, which I would think is a good thing, but for him caused the sandwich to be overstuffed (like I said, weird preferences). He demolished the entire thing, so it must have not been too bad, along with the potato salad, which he was a fan of as well.  All in all, very good lunch experience. I usually get take-out, but the Greek team had their World Cup game, so it seemed appropriate to hang out and watch the “exciting” 0-0 match-up. If we can get some fountain sodas up in there, Athenian will likely jump back on my radar (and I may even get a salad.....maybe).
My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped, we replied no, and she reiterated that the older man dealt with the “list”. We were fine up through now and were still waiting when the older guy came up to the front and shoved the older woman (his wife?) and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes. The entire restaurant went quiet and was staring at the front of the restaurant (where we were awkwardly standing as well). The older gentleman was screaming that she was always interfering with the list and he was done with it. He kept going on and said that why did she even care about a couple of “out of towners” who will never come back again. (which was even more shocking because my girlfriend was a regular and had regularly conversed with the man many times before).   We subsequently left while the man was still screaming at the woman. This was the most absurd display at a restaurant I have ever seen. My girlfriend was extremely upset especially for the physical violence the man was displaying. This was no casual shove but rather a full two handed violent push followed by pounding his fist on the table and screaming at the woman in front of the entire restaurant. Needless to say we will never come back and recommend people boycott a place where the owner treats his (wife/employee) with such disrespect regardless of how stressed he may be on a busy night.
What a find! I found this place thank to my trusty Yelp app. I wanted some good, spicy Mexican food and Rosita's Place seemed to fit the bill. In all honesty I was planning to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...  You park behind the restaurant and walk around the front, dodging a few cars along the way. Walking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm. The service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a good way. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good). They arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer).  Once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!! The flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!  I'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix.
Arrived around midnight and the front desk was ready for us, check in was quick and we were able to turn in. The room was clean, bed comfy, the desk was huge...but the bathroom was small. Breakfast in the morning was very convenient, several choices, and the coffee hit the spot.
Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful, especially the Carolina Turkey Club.
Worst Drive Thru Service Ever!!! Sat for over 10 min such a pain in the ass. Cashiers are rude and still managed to screw up the most basic of orders. I will never come back here
Rosita's Place Rocks! It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food. The green & red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy Chips are fresh and fried on premises. All entrees are quite big and enough to feed two. It draws interesting crowd. I was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits. There were some families, retired folks, emo-kids and bubbas. Try the combination burro with enchilada sauce. Can't go wrong with that. Beer and tequila is reasonably price.
I fell in love with this place as soon as we pulled up and saw the lights strung up and  oldies coming from the speakers!   I tried the banana cream pie hard ice cream, their scoops are very generous!!   My bf got the peach cobbler hard ice cream and that was to die for! We got 4 servings of ice cream for $10, which nowadays is a steal IMO! :)   I'll definitely be heading back with my coworkers this week!
I booked a stay at Hotel San Carlos for one night through Groupon for $76 after taxes. Most other hotels in the area go for $120-300, so finding this deal was awesome. My boyfriend and I live in AZ and he wanted to celebrate his birthday by having a staycation downtown so we could have fun with family and friends without worrying about a way to get home at the end of the night. Originally, we were going to book a night at Hotel Palomar but like I said, we weren't looking to spend a lot of money.  I started reading reviews before we checked in and was feeling nervous that I hadn't made a good decision because there were more bad than good things being said. From the moment we got to the hotel to the time we checked out, our stay was anything from dissappointing. The staff was nice and let us check In early. Before we parked we talked to the valet service and asked for advice on parking. They could have given us excuses to use their service but instead, they pointed across the street and let us know that on the weekends, parking in those spots were free. Awesome! Free parking.   Once we got to our room, everything was clean and the room was a nice temperature. The rooms are small and the bathroom is even smaller but I didn't expect anything else. Its a little ridiculous how many people complained about the raised up part of the floor you have to step over to get in the shower. Wahhh. I barely noticed it, and anyone with a brain should have no problems stepping over it. Also, the shower does fluctuate in temperature when someone flushes a toilet, but it was never an unbearable cold or heat. Once we got settled in we went to the pool, its a cute little pool but by the time we got out there the sun was covered by the building surrounding it, so that was a bummer.   For lunch, we went next door to McCaffery's. They have great food and our bartender was great.   Honestly, I have no complaints about our stay. Its a cute little hotel and for staying on a Saturday night, there were no dramatic noises going on and I didn't hear anyone talking in another room, having sex, or going to the bathroom. I heard a couple of door slams but I think at any hotel its typical. All the bad reviews are obviously from people who have a case of first world problems. Wahhh, “no room service”, Wahhh “the rooms are too small”, Wahhh “I couldn't control the room temperature”, Wahhh “there's something I have to lift my foot up 5 inches from the ground to get over in to the shower”, Wahhh,  Wahhh,  Wahhh.  Get over it people. Take your spoiled attitudes over to the Hyatt.
The service is great, the food is great.  There's not really anything I can add that hasn't been said in the other reviews.  Other than:  If you don't order the beignets for brunch, you are seriously insens\u00e9.  (that's 'insane' in french.  i think.)
OK-so we went to the zoo this past saturday and just our luck it was “the busiest day of the year so far” according to one of the workers.  We had a wonderful time until we got to the paddle boat area and had a horrible customer service experience with an employee named Zach.  We tooled around in the paddle boat for our 20 minute ride and upon leaving went to pick up our $5 deposit.  As we approached the desk Zach raised his voice and said “you will not be receiving your deposit back because you broke the rules and let your daughter sit in an area that is off limits on the boat.” We had no idea what this kid was talking about.  He again raised his voice and people started to stare...he said “you signed a contract that said she wasn't allowed to sit in the middle of the boat.  You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.”  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue, why not tell people when they get in the boat?  So ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $5.  They even had devised a “hand signal” so the person at the cash register would know not to give our money to us.  The most curious thing to us was why didn't they just tell us to have her move over while we were in the boat?  They never mentioned it to us.  It seriously ruined our trip.  Zach, you really take your job way too seriously dude.  Oh, and I stopped payment on my debit card-take that!
Watched Game 1 of the World Series here and had a great time, typical bar food, but excellent service and let us take our time, checked in with us regularly but not too pushy either.
Common Ground gets a lot of flack for being expensive, but really it's only expensive if you're comparing Common Ground's organic items to the conventional items at Schnuck's or Meijer - and several time I've noticed Common Ground's organics were actually priced cheaper than those at the chain stores. You also have to consider the fact that Common Ground is a small, independent grocery store that has to have a higher margin in order to survive - and it tries its best to 'practice what it preaches' in it's business practices, from biodegradable, american-made produce bags to decent employee wages. All those little ethical steps cost money - and since the co-op is community owned, ultimately the money you spend there is going back into the community, rather than in some corrupt CEO's pocket, and that's always a good thing.  Apart from my price-justification rant, this is the most awesome grocery store in town. Great deli with vegan options everyday and beautiful produce - often local and organic - that you can't find anywhere else.
Perhaps it was an off night, but we were really disappointed in our take-out. My husband's pork fried rice was not fried rice...still don't know what it was. His Gen. Tso's chicken was flat and my cashew chicken was flavorless. In the past it has been good food.
The first time my husband brought me here for dinner I thought he was out of his mind. I'm so glad i kept an open mind. It took me a few visits to find my favorite entree and now that I have I'm addicted. My new favorite meal is the arroz con camarones (Shrimp w/ rice). The onions are sweet and the shrimps are flavorful. Yum. Of all the times I have visited Miguel's I have never had a bad experience. The servers are always attentive and nice. Definately give it a try!!
We ordered breakfast here during a layover. My croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water.  Since we plopped down almost 20 bucks, I tried forcing it down until I felt something odd in my mouth.,,  a hair that neither matched my hair's color or ethnicity.  This BK should be shut down!!!!
Glad we tried this at restaurant week prices.  Didn't realize it was  a “corporate” place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of.  We had just said the food was decent but soulless, like you'd expect of a corporate restaurant when that bag arrived to our “oh, that explains it.” Typical South side snob crap.  High prices and low quality and originality  for people who want to be seen and spend alot and have the palettes of a 6 year old.  For more of the same you can buy $25 olive oil that's really canola at  Dean and Deluca next door.   Like the reviewer here  with one unsalted and one over salted selection, I will add that the duck was under cooked and the salmon over cooked. DISAPPOINTING
We decided to give brunch a try for our first visit to Casbah.  We were surprised  by the huge tent covering the “outdoor” dining area.  We opted for an inside table, the interior is somewhat small the tables are close together.  For brunch, you are served your choice of drink, appetizer and entree.    For our drinks, BJ had a Bloody Mary and I had a Bellini.  We were served a basket of yummie bread and mini muffins.  For appetizers, we got a Three Sisters Farms mesclun greens and smoked salmon and truffled potato cake.  Very good.  For entrees we selected a jumbo lump crab & tomato omelet and the NY strip steak.  Very relaxing and tasty meal.
This has been on my AZ bucket list for years and decided to drop by tonight for dinner with the family. From chatting it up with some of the regulars, to the “Texas Trivia” with the owner at our table. The food and the vibe here were absolutely wonderful. Will definitely be back again and again!
FILTHY! I ordered the 9oz house sirloin via Delicious Deliveries. The delivery was very late (not Applebees fault) and I wish we hadn't ordered from there even before I tasted my food. The serving portion was small considering the amount of money I'd paid. The mashed potatoes were filthy and the steak was like rubber, if it even was steak. I've had better steak from Swanson's frozen dinners! I asked for well done, not rubberized! I've never had such filthy food via delivery before. If I had been in the restaurant I would've sent it back, no doubt! Add insult to injury they didn't even include my side of veggies. So I feel completely ripped off and the food was nasty to top it off. I won't be going back here again! Worst experience!
The toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.   I can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful, but they have a long way to go to be a decent hotel.  There are swatches out all over the place connoting a redecoration, but I wonder if it's all because the Ritz is being built across the street...
I've been here quite few times and while F&H isn't perfect it's better than so e of the reviews here make it sound. First the bad, like other reviews have mentioned, sometimes the service can be bit slow. It's usually fine but it admittedly has a few more bad days than some other places. On the other hand they have pretty solid lunch specials, great wings (the Hot BBQ are delicious), and some nice beer specials ($2.50 drafts on Thursday ($2 domestics), Yes Please!) They also have plenty of TVs and a pretty good customer rewards program and when it comes to a sports bar, what more do you really need.
Eh, went here on Christmas for dinner. Had to first seating at 5. Order the special the prime rib, 5 minutes later oh we just sold out of that! great ordered the filet and it was just ok. Wine was outrageously overpriced. Amazing this place gets such great reviews. Oh and im OG palm one goer. The lobbies would have been a better call.
Decided to take a short trip downtown to try the Central Coast Wine Tasting event held here last week.  We had a blast!  While the rep that hosted the wine tasting made the wine tasting a fun and informative event, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and FOOD!   The tapas plate that came with the wine tasting was fabulous, blue cheese and bacon stuffed dates, a super tasty California cheese (bought some to take home) and a tiny, but very yummy shrimp salad. That only made us want to try more!    Jeannie loves scallops, so naturally she ordered the Scallop Martini.  I know deep down she did not want to share, but she graciously fed me one of those monsters.  She said they are the best she has ever had and I have a hard time arguing with her.  Three big, tender, perfectly cooked and seasoned scallops resting in a Martini glass.  The accompanying sauce was absolutely delicious.  We also ordered a single cheese plate with a cheese from Spain, Mahon (I think).  Loved that one too, so of course we bought some to enjoy later.   Won't wait for a wine tasting to make our return....
I began attending the Midwife Center for well-woman care about three years ago, then chose the Midwife Center as my care provider when I became pregnant with my daughter a year and a half ago.  I can't say enough good things about this place, from the inviting atmosphere to the knowledgeable and supportive midwives to the very helpful nurses and lactation consultant.  My daughter was born in the Forest Room, and it was everything I'd hoped for.  One of the saddest parts about leaving Pittsburgh for me this past summer, when we had to move for my husband's job, was having to say goodbye to the Midwife Center.  I am hoping to find someplace half as wonderful in our new city.
This review is strictly based on the Sun Prairie location and is only a review on the service received, not the food. I have had Papa Murphy's pizza at other locations and the pizza was good. Unfortunately at this location I wasn't given a chance to get a pizza. I walked into the store at 5 minutes to 8pm. 8pm is when they close. Not only did my phone, my car, and my watch indicate that it was before 8pm but the actual clock inside the store was showing 7:55. I soon as I walked into the restaurant I was told that they were closed even though there was another customer in the store getting a pizza as well. You don't even bake the pizza! How much effort would it have been to take one more order and make one more pizza? The total transaction could have been done and it still probably wouldn't have been 8! It's not like the store had already been cleaned and it would have been a hassle to reopen everything. I would have been completely understanding of that. There are a lot of pizza options in sun prairie. Go there.
Legendarily lame.  This place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade. Tactics include: carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food.  Going to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower.  It's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly.  It's like watching Schindler's List during a bachelor party.  It's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend's parent's house.   Not fun at all.
This is a nice looking but poorly designed hotel. Despite having over 300 rooms, they only have 2 elevators. I was here for a convention with a friend who recently had foot surgery and needed a wheelchair. Lets just say other hotel guests were not gracious about giving us priority on the elevators even though we were on the second floor and even the largest of humans should be able to manage 1 flight of stairs with 2 good feet. Checkout was a nightmare because of this elevator situation. Fortunately a staff member was kind enough to allow us access to the service elevator after he saw how rude the guests were about this.  The food is also terrible and overpriced. Several people at the convention developed food poisoning after consuming the calamari. That was no fun for anybody. I highly recommend the Sprecher Brewery restaurant across the street - comprable prices but larger portions and significantly better food!   The temperate throughout the facility is horrible as well. Our room was cold no matter how high we adjusted the thermstat and the convention space was hot enough that I nearly fainted on at least 2 occasions. The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because it was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable with their down-filled duvets and fluffy pillows.
I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...  We ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were “slightly undercooked” and he was “trained that most food was sushi grade.” Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good.   Lastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.  I can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.  Prices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts.
We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.  We will never return.
I first went to Merry Ann's the night I craved The Home Stretch Haystack. Merry Ann's version paled in comparison. I gave them another shot a few weeks later, this time for lunch.  I ordered a blue plate special, country fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas. The country fried steak patty was chopped formed, deep fried, and covered with a gravy dry mix, which also covered the potatoes. The peas were from a can. Haven't eaten there since.
My new coworkers invited me to go get “cheap mexican” with them for lunch. Now, from where I work, you could walk to more skeevy, run down looking, hole in the wall mexican joints than you can count on a hand, and I'm pretty sure at least a few of them would be absolutely delicious (as hole in the wall restaurants tend to be). Unfortunately, I can not report on any of them, because we drove by them and went to Zapatas.  I won't say that Zapata's was bad, partially because i don't think it is deserved and partially because it feels like I am giving credit for more effort than they earned. While the salsa that came with our gratis basket of chips was full of cilantro and onion flavor, that was the high point of the meal. We ate off the lunch menu, and I went with the enchilada and taco plate. The meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful. The taco shell tasted like it was pulled out of the grocery store box on my pantry shelf. The rice was bland and slightly overcooked. I do have to give them credit for the enchilada sauce being kinda tasty, but nothing I wouldn't expect from a jarred sauce. The low point was definitely the refried beans, which are often my favorite part. I took one mouthful, found them utterly disgusting and left the rest of them on my plate to form a sad, cold congealed mess.  I have often thought that quality service can redeem an otherwise forgettable meal, well in that case creepy, unpleasant service can cement a bad impression. Despite our party of three being one of less than a handful of patrons in his section, our waiter was slow to get to our table even after being called over. He gave off a used car salesman type of aura and loses additional point for trying to talk me into drinking tequila on my lunch break.  The only reason I can imagine returning to Zapata's would be at my coworkers request, and even then I might think about sticking with the tuna sandwich I brought from home. Oh, and as for that “cheap” bit. The lunch pricing is in the 6-10 dollar range, which isn't particularly remarkable when there are tacos to be found for under 2 bucks.
I'm a creature of habit--I've been getting a savory and sweet item each time I'm around the neighborhood. White lily cake is divine! Quiches always tasty. Macarons are alittle too sweet. I wish the cake slices weren't $4/pop. Otherwise, would be a regular here.
It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me “I can't do this, I can't do that”. Worst service ever!
I came here looking to have my bridesmaids try on dresses. I'd called before hand to make sure they had the right dresses in stock and they said they did. But when I arrived, they couldn't find the dresses, the girl who was supposed to help me had no idea where to even find the section for a certain designer (their area of BM dresses was not that large), and when they gave up looking, they just left me. Didn't say they couldn't find them or that they weren't in stock. Then when I complained that they had said they had them on the phone, they blamed me and said I must not have said bridesmaid dresses when I asked on the phone. They were rude, unprofessional and I will never recommend them.
The Mexican pizza add beef and cream cheese is to die for!  Their fried ice cream is the best ever.  The chili relleno is very flavorful and delicious.   My favorite Mexican food  restaurant!
Wow what a great flavor for the dishes we had it was nearly impossible to stop eating even after our belly was completely full. The waiter was really great as well knew the food and had been there since the place opened. He gave is great recommendations all super delish. It was a really positive experience we will go back!
Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!  It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me.   I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, “Are you working?” and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.  In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B.   I was just really turned off from that experience.   The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me.   It's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.
Meh, I've experienced better is an understatement.  Friday's is like the “fine dining chain” for every yinzer in Pittsburgh...  1.  When we were seated, it was quick which was a surprise.  Somehow this restaurant gets packed and I never understand why.  I was happy about that. 2.  I ordered one of their “skinny margaritas”, blackberry to be exact.  It was a nice size, however, at $6.00/pop, that was half of my food bill. 3.  The waitress started off attentive, but after our food came out she was gone.  I ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard.  Loaded mashed potato on the side because I wanted heartburn ha! 4.  Food came.  My burger had lettuce on it only.  Waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks.  I had to wait to ask for my pickle. 5.  The loaded potatoes were more like rubber than potatoes and not what I was expecting.  Disappointment. 6.  The waitress then went into oblivion and only returned with our check.    Never again will I eat at Friday's.  I will, however, go should a happy hour arise...
It's like a portal into a chasm of anime, classics, world, documentary and varied films and cartoons. For Champaign, these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films.  What prevents me from giving it 5 starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them, including being over 18 (for *ANY* film)
I read about their Operation Santa Claus holiday charity campaign via friends on Yelp (thanks Jolly!) and called in to make a donation to help those in need.  I am always impressed when a media outlet gives up their airtime to support a local charity....kudos to the team @ ABC 15 for putting together this event!
Have not been here in years.  The food & the service were not good. And you would think that a margarita at a Mexican restaurant would at least be drinkable, but it was so sweet I could not drink it. It may have been an off night, but I think I will probably wait a few more years again to go back.
HORRIBLE college. Good luck going there or getting help when you needi it. The only person I found to be helpful was Brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job. I will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication I have recieved. I do NOT reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education. I have never seen such a horrible COMMUNITY COLLEGE in my life time.
Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day.
My ode to the Swizzle...  You would never think much of this place, looking at it from the outside, that's if you can even find it. It is tucked behind the drive through Starbucks.   The swizzle rocks! Flat out.   It is small and cozy. The drinks are stiff and cheap. The jukebox has great music to entertain yourself with. There is a pool table (which I have dominated). And no food. Yes..no food. This is a bar! And a dive at that.   They have the best women's bathroom (as voted by citysearch I believe).  All around, this place kept me sane for years and still does when I come back to visit. Be sure to speak with the regulars, as many of them have awesome stories.  A true gem.
I was a little nervous about shopping here after reading the reviews, but since it was closest to our hotel, we gave it a try.  It was fine. Nothing worse than you'd find in the SF Bay Area. Buck up, little campers. Quit being so stuck up.
Played on 2/3/14.  Very poor conditions, both fairways & greens.  I would rate this as the worst course I have played in AZ.  Also the green fee of $85 is ridiculous.  Green fee does not include range balls, that were seemingly taken out of the desert & ponds. Two thumbs down!
Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?
For me, no trip to my alma matre is complete without a visit to Empire.  I doubt I can be completely objective; I love the place too much.  I mean, I've watched the family's kids grow up!  I recommend the General Tso's chicken.  The flavor of the sauce is amazing and the consistency of the chicken excellent.  Sit by the window and watch the campus walk by below... great location.
For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for.   The only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.
I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.  There were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.  Unfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.  I had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.  If the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.
Overall a decent yet confusing experience... Pros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things, including shuttle rides. Cons: Extremely inconsistent room cleaning service! If you're staying for an extended period of time, they only clean your room once a week on an assigned day. The problem is, they don't show on the assigned day to clean. My roommate and I have ended up calling the office, sometimes twice before it's cleaned. Also, someone in our  building had $1,900 stolen out of her drawer, and the management told her not to call the cops. They ended up cutting her check, but not before a lot of stern talk. I wouldn't stay here again...if you do, make sure that you use the safe provided in the room, and expect to do a lot of the maid services yourself.
Stopped in here for lunch one day and wasn't pleased with the experience. The rolls were warm and fell apart. The service was fair at best and the place wasn't even very busy. Not that Phoenix is known for it's Sushi, but you'd expect better from a place like this. All that said, the menu is a hoot and worth a read, just don't order anything from it.
WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better .
I've been to A-Ri-Rang several times now and I have to say that I am not a fan. None of the dishes are particularly great, and I would even dare to say that most are vastly bland by Korean standards (my S. Korean friend really didn't like the beef bulgogi).   Being that it takes a very long time to get your food, and that finding seats for groups larger than 2 people is nearly impossible, I am not likely to return -- There are definitely better Korean restaurant in the extreme vicinity.
This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.  No more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.) ONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening.   Oh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events.
One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g., STL to PHF) invariably seem to have me jumping across a few terminals to make my connection.  You'd think the situation would be improved by the huge number of moving walkways connecting the different gates, but there is NOTHING more infuriating than being stuck behind a family of four blocking the entire walkway, or someone slowly trudging along on the left.  For god's sake, people: Just like on the road, pass on the left, walk on the right.  There are people in this airport, obviously not you, that are in a HURRY.  Can't speak much to the food and drink options here.  The selections seem plentiful.  US Airways was friendly to me here, too, when a flight was canceled back home.  They shuttled me to a nearby hotel -- I forget where -- and covered both my transportation and lodging for the night.  Good work, guys.
Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's.
I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges. Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.  The service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.  But what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!
Great products and Katie has been the best!
I ordered flowers for two friends. When I spoke to the designer about the size he was more then helpful with exchanging some of the flowers to create a bigger bouquet. It's almost two weeks later and my friend said they still look beautiful just as when they arrived. Both friends said they were lovely. I will use them again.
What a fun place to get ideas for your house! They have over 100 booths from different vendors selling everything from jewelry to furniture. We spent a few hours here and bought a few unique treats!
I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine. Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not “just looking” but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.  You would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates design; not just another customer.  Now with that rant out of the way, I'd like to let you know that you'll find some cool shit here. Its a serious challenge to see everything there is in such a cramped place, so plan ahead to spend some time there. And for the love of God, don't bring your kid. In fact, go alone so you can make it around easier.  You wont find everything in perfect condition, but the prices are very reasonable. I felt like I was getting away with murder when I picked up a lamp last time. Go support Petey and his dog, they're good at what they do.
I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future.
I had really high hopes, and I was thrilled that it's so close to my house... However I soon started second guessing myself after pulling up. I was there before anyone else and watched the attendant avoid my car and instead go to the 2 old guys in expensive sport cars that showed up 2 or so minutes after me, and she even waited a little longer after that like she was hoping another car would pull up. When one didn't, she finally came to my car (and her attitude sucked on top of it). It's not like I own a nasty beat up car either, it's a newer Mitsubishi. After telling her I wanted a full interior detail and an exterior wash I went inside and sat around for a few hours. When it was finally done, I got what I expected, a nice, shiny, clean car.. with a soaking wet interior. Granted, I've never had an interior detail before, but I didn't expect everything to be sopping wet regardless of that. They actually put down a plastic cover over my seat for me, but since I had to stop at some place afterwards I accidently ripped it and then had to ride around with a wet bottom. I was told to keep the windows cracked an inch or 2, and did the whole weekend, however now my car kinda stinks and I'm going to be pissed if theres mold or mildew factoring into that. I'm not happy, and I'm not going back either. I'm giving them 2 stars because they did what I asked them to do: they cleaned my car.  P.S. I work at an insurance company. I spoke to an appraiser and found out that places should really be doing a dry shampoo to avoid screwing up the foam bits they have under your carpets and inside your seat.
this is a newer, cleaner location.  their agua frescas are very good. get the cheese crisp! delicious simplicity!  free chips and salsa if you dine inside!
God help you when there's a wrestling tournament in town and you're checking out a grad program in CU.  No Union, no historic Lincoln....yes Super 8.  Now, Super 8 is...a Super 8.  You are not expecting a bevy of Milanese opera singers, clad in diaphanous shawls and wet with the last cloying droplets of the spring rain, to entertain you with their siren songs in front of the tiny fireplace in the antiseptic lobby.  But, you aren't expecting to see smoking/non-smoking rooms (least if you're from California, a land where tobacco smoking results in summary execution by armed guards)--and being put up in a smoking room is not much of a boon, especially when it smells as if the entire room is an ashtray.  When I mentioned this to the disinterested yet vaguely friendly guy at the front lobby, he pulled his head back from teh phone where he was chattin' with his ladyfriend just long enough to query, “Hey, you want Pops to go up and Febreeze that for ya?”  He then gestured in the general direction of a stooped, wizened gentleman, wrinkled and neat, who looked exhausted.  I gulped back shame as I reached for the doorknob to leave.  “Um, yeah, can you Febreeze it?”    That night it smelled like someone had been smoking in a flowery meadow.    The one additional star is for the free wireless in the room.  But I felt I had to taste the air, so I don't know if it really should get that extra estrella.  I'm so sorry, Pops.  But thanks for the Febreezin' anyway.
Either they need to hire more baristas or they need to work in faster pace.  I ordered a very simple drink and waited for over 5 minutes for it.  It was also during evening rush hours, but that shouldn't be the reason why my drink took a long time to make.  Not impressed at all.
Kind of a depressing dive bar - not really my kind of hangout.  If I liked the burger, I'd recommend only ordering it to go.  I went with a patty melt, and was not impressed.  The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.  Combined with the atmosphere and general grungy feeling (I don't know how sanitary the place is, but I wouldn't bet on it passing inspection), I definitely won't be back.
La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth.   Get the chilaquiles! Get them.   We also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape\u00f1os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of.   I'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation.
terrible selection of shoes and jeans, and the changing rooms smell like a red line el stop. if you absolutely must visit a department store, drive a few miles and hit up macy's instead.
Dan is 'da Bomb!  If you want an HONEST assessment of the extent of your phone repair, and competent, reliable, and fairly priced service, Sun Cellular is the place to go.  If you want a pretty picture, a low ball price, then an unpleasant surprise once the other guy has torn your phone down, go somewhere else.  Brought a phone in with an oddball part needing replacement, that needed to be ordered.  Dan was very specific; he let me know the part was unusual and needed to be ordered from manufacturer, how long it would take to get it, and the cost.  I wasn't thrilled with the wait or the cost of the part.  I called a few other places, who told me “yeah, we can have that done today (or tomorrow)...”, widely varied pricing, all on the low side.   I asked them to verify that they had the correct part in, and NONE of them had it, and the cost and the wait time went up with all of them.  I can just see it now... you bring the other guys your phone, they tear it down, THEN tell you “oops, gonna hafta wait, cost is higher”.  Now you're a captive audience, and they have your phone.  BAD news!    Needless to say, Dan got the phone, and fixed it.  He was right on the price, right on the wait time, he knows his business.  Labor fees are low.  He's got my business for life.  Thanks, Dan!
Best sushi I've had so far in Charlotte! Make sure you try their Coastal Roll; my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the price!  Wonderful restaurant and evening all around!
I ate here 2 years ago and had one of the best meals. Not sure what changed, oh wait, it's the quality of the fish. I got the caldo de pescados. The sea bass was gross. So then they brought me a sea bass with ancho chiles that looked good but again, the fish was no bueno. I'm real sorry. I drove 30 minutes out of the way to come here and had 2 inedible entrees.   Crab tostada, guacamole and margarita were ok but not worth the embarrassment of not eating 2 different dinners. The staff was super nice about it and the owner didn't charge me. I wanted to pay but he refused. So nice but I felt terrible. Bad dream.
food is still good , slice of pastami n rye is heaven on earth, with dr brown root beer no y ou didn't jgo for the ambience its those delcious heartstoping sandwhciches..and be patient you mave have wait for a table.. but you can always take out..smile
What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.
What the hell, Phil's Tavern? Every time I come here (usually before a show), things just don't work out. I wanted them to, but they just didn't.  FOOD: The only food I've tried here were the jalapano poppers, and then I never tried anything here again. How do you burn something in a deep fryer? Normally I'd just be impressed, but I was hungry.   DRINKS: Their drink specials are nothing to write home about. The dirty martini was weak, and the tiny, shrivelled, Spanish olives skewerd on a coffee stir did not impress. At least it was only $5. Unfortunately, the Corona of the person I was with only cost fifty cents less than that. $4.50 for a warm Corona? Do not want.  SERVICE: Nice, but few and far between.  ATMOSPHERE: Dank, dirty, sticky... these are only a few of the descriptors for this place. I fear the day where I will have no choice but to use the facilities here.  Overall:  Don't waste your time and money. I hear there's better places in this area, I just need to find them.
STAFF:  The most kind hotel staff I've had the chance to meet.  Atmosphere was down to earth, professional and efficient.  A well oiled staff no matter who was at the front desk.  All policies stayed the same from person to person.  I'd like to make special mention of Joe (staffer), who didn't rush me off but listened to my request and immediately went into action to do research and obtain information about relocating to the area.  Joe was a positive person and nothing but a gentleman.  Southern hospitality DOES still exist!  FACILITY:  NO noise!  I mean absolutely no noise from the hall or surrounding rooms.  Parking was plentiful and easily accessible; no long walks to your car.  The parking lot was well lit and I observed no shenanigans during my week stay.    CONVENIENCE STORE:  A pretty neat concept where you purchase necessities (Tide, Chips, Soda, etc.) and you are billed - - All on the Honor System!  Sweet!  ROOM:  The room was clean and smelled good.  I am very particular about cigarette smoke!  The bed slept like a Dream!  The room was spacious.  The full kitchen was convenient; included a refrigerator, stove, microwave, pots/pans, dishes, glasses, coffee cups and to go coffee cups, colander and a pyrex dish for microwavable items.  My only complaint was that I had NO cell service whatsoever while in the room to which I asked one of the hotel staff and they immediately asked if I had SPRINT which I do.  Wowzers!  That's definitely going to be another review.  Humpf!  Overall my 7 day stay felt like I was right at home and it can't get any better than that!
I have been to The Ultimate several times for massages with Ellen and would highly recommend her.  She is very personable, friendly and professional.  I feel extremely relaxed after our sessions.  I also used Ellen for a prenatal massage when pregnant. Being as big and uncomfortable as I was, I was worried if I would be able to relax fully.  Ellen has blankets and pillows just for that reason! Super comfortable and she remembers to ask about the baby after she was born. Highly recommend!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that the hallway outside the room can get a bit loud if people are walking down, talking or laughing. They should maybe make that more of a quiet space with notices that people are in session.  Nothing Ellen could help though!
Girls are hot, dances are cheap, bouncers aren't power tripping. Everything a strip club should be. Only gripe is that I wish the back room was bigger and more private
An associate of mine brought me lunch. TOGO and it was delicious. We tried the Spicy Chicken that was very flavorful and not burning your lips off. I tried their lo mein, which was delicious with varitey of meats. Finally I had the beef and broccoli with had a ginger/ orange sauce. Very tasty the beef was well cooked and medium, not tough. JUST ALL AROUND DELICIOUS.
Went here yesterday to see the drag show with my friend (and fellow transperson) Fenyx.  Cruisin had everything I would ever want out of a bar; seedy atmosphere, cheap drinks, a stage, friendly bartenders, and trannies, crossdressers, and drag queens as far as the eye could see. For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's.   But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.  While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side.   So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.  “Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,” we say, playfully.  The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with “Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out” before walking off with his cigarette.  “What the hell just happened?” I ask. “He thinks we're a straight couple.”  I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.  I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar.   I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.  I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.  Oh well. Torrid and Guitar Center seem to do just fine without my business. I'm sure Cruisin 7th will do just fine.
Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend & I had hamburgers. I also had a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had.  My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them. They quickly brought her a new one. We finished up with a huge Turtle sundae we shared. Caution: this sundae is not for only one person.  Our service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), so seating was easy. At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event.   Overall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try.
In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again.
Let me start out by saying that my ONLY critique and the ONLY reason I didn't give them five stars, is I made reservations on Open Table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant, they put us in the bar.  But, I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent, the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful.  I had their 16th St short rib stew (and kuddos that you have a small portion option) and it was scrumptious.  I practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when I don't offer to have anyone taste my dish.  It had been a long time since we were there and I doubt if it will be a long time before we go back.
When I'm out and people ask for advice about where they should go next, I send them here.  I love this place. It could be packed or completely empty... doesn't matter. I always have a good time. Sober or drunk. Yes, I have in fact been here sober. Go ahead, bring the jokes.  Connolly's is like a family. Many of the bartenders have worked here for years. They are all super friendly and damn good at slinging drinks. These are the same masterminds involved in Tyber Creek, Dandelion and Prohibition. They know what they're doing.  The patio is huge. Perfect for after work cocktails or Sunday funday. Cornhole, tables, TVs. Pick your poison. Speaking of poison, if you're in the mood for a car bomb... go here to get it. And be sure to buy me one.   Fridays and Saturdays you can typically expect a cover. It's usually just $5. You'll find that at several bars in uptown.  I'm happy this uptown staple is not only still kicking it, but also remains one of the most popular watering holes in Center City. I know I don't have to say this, but don't ever change Connolly's.
Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a “Hello” from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.  P.S. I ordered a Diet Coke, and received a glass of what seems to be Robitussin. That, or there's alcohol in this drink. Either case, I'm not thrilled.
I don't know how this place stays in business. The menu is so limited. Would you like chicken or chicken? Chicken in a pita? Chicken on some lettuce? Chicken rolled in a tortilla? And the pita chips are bland! Yuck! And  the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy. I've only been twice and tried different dishes both times but I just don't get anything greek about this place.
I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.  I signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said, we need internet nowadays.  We need cable TV in order we can get national or world news, more informatory program or some quality programs.  They were fast to install for you.  But when you do not have service, it takes forever to talk to someone on the phone or they hanged you up after waiting forever.  However when I wanted to seek their help, they would not answer you without a pin and kept transfer you to so many departments (really that big, I don't know) till your phone call dropped.  That will take you hours on the phone without a solution.  As I need to move and cancel the account, they will give you a hard time.  Watch out this company.
Cooperstown Sports Grill Does NOT disappoint!   Cooperstown offers an incredible selection of beers, good food and excellent service.  The prices are reasonable, and the servers are outstanding.    Cooperstown Sports Grill is big, filled with large screens televisions. The walls are covered in vintage guitars signed by every rock star and rare sports collectibles signed by past & present icons.   The food entrees have celebrity names, like the Bill O'reilly BBQ sandwiches, Kurt Warner corned beef,  AZ Cardinals Country BBQ chicken salad, or my favorite the “Jeff”  grilled chicken salad.  I would put the grilled chicken salad up against anybody (including Durant's or even Arrogant Butcher).  So if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix give Cooperstown Sports Grill a try, it does not disappoint
No, no, no, no. That's all I can say if you are planning on eating here.    My daughter and I went in today, on a Sunday afternoon, because we couldn't find another Mexican restaurant that was open on Sunday in central Phoenix. The service was fine but the food was awful. The beans tasted like they came from a can (Rosarita brand) and the salsa was just barely palatable for the same reason. We each ate only half of our food before  leaving.    When the waiter asked how the food was, I told him and all he did was say he was sorry. No offer to bring something else or comp one of our half-eaten meals.   Macayo's on Central used to have fresh food, now it is just stale and tastes like it comes from a can. You can definitely tell that they are cutting corners in the kitchen. For the prices they charge, You have a right to expect better food.   I will never go there again.
The chicken wings are great. Everything else was ugh. I had the shrimp with broccoli which by the way was mostly broccoli and the rice tasted like pool water. Never again!!
First of all, a disclaimer. The only thing I have ever ordered here is the Pho Tai. I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad. That said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory.  I both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce. Delicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.
It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of eateries, shopping and even a spa.  The only thing that sucks is if you have a short layover and have to run from one end of the airport to the other to make your plane.  It's a HUGE airport. On my layover on my way out I did get to enjoy a great lox sandwich at Einstein Bros Bagels.   On my way back I had 15 minutes to get to my plane.  I suppose I should have asked one of the carts for help.
I stayed three nights here on business and really enjoyed the hotel and its staff. The place felt clean, up-to-date, and comfortable. All the staff were friendly and everything was easy, from check-in to check-out.   The rooms have high ceilings and were nicely furnished, and the 3rd floor courtyard even had its own bbq for guest use, which seemed like a nice thought.   I'd stay there again for sure.
Not my first choice for Mexican food by far but when I have mo choice so be it. The staff is ehh and not that friendly or fast. The only thing I will eat here is the rolled tacos, everything else I've had is not up to my Mexican food standards by a long shot.
If you want burned pizzas, go here.  If you want to pay full price for an incomplete order, go here.  I wish I could have given them zero stars because even one star is too many!
Went there with my girlfriend for what I thought would be good bbq. She ordered the half chicken and I got a pulled pork sandwich.  Not only did her chicken come out pink and bleeding once but it happened twice. When I told them the first time the cashier said, “we usually have good food.” So it's okay to serve bad food too? He asked how the chicken was when he was bringing in the chairs from outside and we said the same,  still pink and bleeding. All he said was oh okay and walked away. I didn't even eat my sandwich because if they couldn't cook chicken right why should I trust them to cook the pork correctly? When I went to the front to talk with them they all disappeared.  Never would I think about going back and spend my money there again.
The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center.
Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down.  I had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place.
I really, really want to like Showmars because it's local, but it's just kind of icky in the environment. It was probably a unique spot before they spread all over the area, but now that Charlotte is super-saturated, it's just not that interesting.   The french fries are ok, I guess. The veggie pita is no good...clearly designed by someone who has never eaten food without meat on it. Maybe I was disappointed because I had high expectations, and maybe it's an alright place for the meat-eaters...but it's just not good for me. I haven't had a good experience, and I've been to a few locations. I won't be going back.
Great food. I had the hooley kebab for dinner. It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it. Huge portion. Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star;)
DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible.
I have seen quite a few games & concerts at US Airways Center, and now having the light rail, it makes getting into and out of downtown Phoenix so much easier! Plus with a game ticket you can ride for free, up to 4 hours before to 4 hours after the event for FREE!!! And the train stops are walking distance from the arena.  Never a bad time at US Airways Center
I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small, the place is small, and the foods no more than average. I have been there twice now, thinking the first time might have been a fluke. We've heard so much about it that I have super high expectations. Their wine bar in the back is cute, but small. We couldn't even lift our elbows to sip our drink. While the waiters and service are good, the food is just not impressive. The pasta I got was good, but nothing to write home about. I got a pizza the second time I visited and it had a horrid taste. I don't know if it was the spinach or the cheese but something was VERY potent. They're pricy as well. The only thing I will give them credit for their Italian wedding soup. There's practically nothing in it, as they use think rice instead of noodles, but the broth and meatballs are to die for! Overall, not impressed. I probably won't return.
We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too.   The downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was “20 minutes until closing time.” This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the “oh, you have a half hour before we close” trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out.
This is my go-to distributer. They have a great selection and lots of hard to find brews. I haven't noticed that it's any more expensive than going elsewhere but honestly if I don't buy here then I'm buying six packs which as we all know are a huuugggge rip off. So any time I have a case of something I love I feel like I'm getting a bargain. The cold selection does suck so I try to plan ahead and have what I need already cold. Staff here are all very helpful- and will have recommendations if you ask.
Famous Dave's is so much better!! I use to go here all the time when i was growing up and i loved it, i don't know what happened but there food really went down the drain... the ribs are dry and black on the bottom and the fries have way too much seasoning. I think Jon needs to get back in the kitchen instead of spending all his time at the bar next door.
Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying “just 2”. As though 2 people was not enough. Well, I can appreciate some good hospitality and a welcoming personality before patronizing a restaurant that I don't frequent very often.
I could visit this place four times and give it four different reviews. Today there was a long wait at the cutting table, which was (at first) staffed by three different people. The little number-giving-out machine was empty, so we all just stood in an orderly line. One of the women at the cutting table left right after I got there (there were five of us in line then) saying that she was already late for her break. I didn't like to see her go, but I understood about the break thing (sometimes you *really* need your break, and sometimes your manager *really* wants you to take your break at the scheduled time).   It took a long time to get my stuff cut because one women kept cutting but the other one was helping a customer track down some numbers on a fabric. If I was that customer I'd have been thrilled at that level of service.   So I finally got my stuff cut. The woman cutting it was very efficient (but I think a little rattled from being so busy) and admired my choice of fabric (hey, I love to be validated).   I went up front and stood in line some more. There were, unusually, three different people working the registers. The woman who checked me out was mellow and chatty and also admired my fabric (I'm starting to think it's not my great taste but some new policy).   So not a great visit but not the worst, either.
Do not eat here. Terrible.
Stars are for the food only.    2.5 rating  Got there at 8pm on Saturday night, they told us it was an hour wait which was expected, but it only took 30minutes to be seated so that was a bonus.  Started off with the lettuce wraps and i used to be a fan of these but they just seem to bore me now(FYI-love the lettuce wraps at the cheesecake factory).  I had the Singapore rice noodles.  This was so so as i thought immediately that lu lu noodles and asian cafe are better.  The fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw.   Some good notes were the Dynamite shrimp, plump, juicy, tangy with a small kick.    Sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick.   The service was annoying.   We were there less than 45 minutes and it seemed like our waiter was in a rush to get us out of there.   Constantly asking if he could remove my plate.  I had to sternly say at one point that I will let you know when i am finished.  I found it rude especially since  there wasn't even a line at this point.    I think we will travel elsewhere following a movie.  The result never quite met the anticipation.
Yet another Hertz location that doesn't have cars for reservations.  Ridiculous wait as they make us sit here waiting for returns to come in.  Seriously, take a taxi.  #hertz
Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious, and I'm freaking thrilled when a restaurant knows what a caramelized onion is supposed to look like!  My flatbread was smothered in them, just the way I like it.  The sashimi was nothing crazy, I liked the grilled pineapple with it.    My husband got himself a burger, the barbecue one, to be exact, and I had the wild mushroom pasta.  I was concerned it would be too similar to the flatbread, but the server raved about it, so I tried it anyway.    My husband enjoyed his burger, though he thought it could have been less salted.  He was happy that the temperature was correct, also.   The salad that came with my entree was... Ok.  The blue cheese dressing was eh, the cherry tomatoes seemed kinda squishy, and I actually spit out a crouton.  It had this weird feeling in my mouth of being a tasteless cube of crunchy oil.  I usually love croutons too.  The pasta was tasty, but almost too tasty, if that makes sense.  Too many competing flavors.  My husband was thrilled that they got “al dente” right, when he had a bite.  I'd also note that the pasta is much more of a dinner meal than lunch, but there aren't a ton of options for people trying to avoid meat.  Overall, I'd eat here again, and get the same apps and a lighter entree.
Nice place and I did not stay there....but think twice before holding a meeting or multi-day conference here. They have one restroom per sex and those are one seaters only! Not cool. Also, I watched a bin of garbage sit under the stairway ALL WEEK....and it never got moved. Nice....
When you work with their physical therapist(pt) you spend most of your time with the physical therapy assistant. The time you do spend with the physical therapist is very hurried and the focus is on getting on to the next patient not your healing. Not having gone to a PT before I had no idea how terrible they were till I went to an amazing group. I went to Toca P.T. for 4 months after which I was still in pain but they released me and said “do the exercise and that is all they can do.”  After only 6 sessions with a great P.T. I am finally almost pain free. Toca is in the business to make money not to provide great physical therapy. Wish I could give them no Stars, and get my wasted time back.
Ick.  Stay away unless you want to be treated like you are a criminal who cannot afford a pricey item.  I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.  He would not let me handle the coat myself because it was “very expensive.”  He watched me while I tried it on and then immediately took it off me.  I wanted to tell him that $400 wasn't pricey for a winter coat and that I could easily afford it, but decided to walk out without purchasing it.  I won't be back.
I have to agree with the other two star rating.This place used to be top notch.Over the last 7 years they have gone way down. In quality service and in how the food is presented. I wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers. hope that upper management will look into this. I would like to come back and see an emprovement.
I went to this venue for the Carnivore's tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again. This time when I went, we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was WAY better. The line of sight to the show was great, and although I'd prefer to be closer to the stage, it was a great experience. Awesome show, great accommodations.
I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.  The positives:   The vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.  The negatives:  Dim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.  The only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.  The food is only okay.    All in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.
Good price, matches quality
Back in CU for the holidays....boy were we disappointed. Used to love thisplace..but really gone down in quality and service. Ordered the Antipasto, which I used to enjoy when Frank was there....I got a place of lettuce with a few packaged pepperoni and NO KALAMATA olives or any type of olive at all...no pepperchoni, ,,,9 dollars and change. Absolutely terrible. Pasta was cold...Service was slow with few customers...would not be surprised if this  place closed soon. If youthink this s the ld MANZELLA..forget it...not as good or even close to what it used to be!!!!!
Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.  I had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me “I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you.” So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.  Funny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.  Also, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have.   For those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer.
“The staff take time to “know” us and our pets. The physicians are professional, expert in their field and very caring of our pets. They do not over prescribe, but stay on point and specific to any issues or concerns. We receive excellent care in the veterinary service, the staff, the kennel and the grooming. I have referred several friends and ... they agree. thank you.”
Terrible. For a city so lavishly seasoned with some of the best Mexican food on the planet, this place coulnt have been worse if it tried. Outdated, dingy, dining space and help. I love me a good hole in the wall, but Jordan's can't even hit that mark. Avoid it!!!
Tried this place for lunch, had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime.
First time customer today.  It is truly a dive but the sandwiches are great.  Large portions, fresh bread and cheap...
The two stars are bonus points, but it gets the basics wrong.  pro:  - Bright, airy - I never need to walk miles to get to the terminal  - Very cool statues greet people to the Queen City, those always put a smile on my face.   cons:  - No restaurants or bars available to hang out with family and friends and wait for the (often delayed) departing flight. That's a deal breaker for me. Security checks are here to stay, do something about it.   - TSA agents are often rude and overly aggressive. Yes, compared to other big cities.   - Employing bathroom attendants, News Break: hello, the fifties are over!   - Not enough airlines service Charlotte or compete for its business.   - Not enough direct flights in or out. Unless I want to make the trip 4 hours longer that need be, the only direct flights to London are with USfreakingAirways. For a wannabe INTERNATIONAL HUB that's not too famous.
I am from out of town and have never been to a restaurant at a ball game, so I was excited to go to Front Row to watch the DBacks game. The website gave very conflicting messages about when you could purchase the seats in Front Row for the game, so I gave the restaurant a call over a week in advance. They said I could only purchase tables the day of. I called the night before the game, hoping that maybe they would make an exception because I really wanted these tickets. I then found out that the tickets have been available all season! I asked to speak to the manager, who was the rudest human being I have ever spoke to in my life! After about an hour on the phone with him, tears, and being called a liar, I decided to hang up and just call customer service. I understand that the table I wanted had already been reserved, I just wanted the manager (Lyle) to try to help fix the issue. He said there was nothing he could do, and that “EVERYONE knows you can buy the tickets all year round”... what a piece of crock. I cannot believe I was talked to in the way that he spoke to me, and I am so thoroughly upset and aggravated at him. I just read some previous reviews about him on this site, and it's so funny that everyone agrees with me. If you don't have any issue when you go there, then you'll be fine. But if you have even the slightest complaint that has to go through Lyle.... don't expect to leave happy.
Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable.
Taking in a Surprise   Taking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry. The first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off South Tryon. It was so bright it was reflecting off the mirror statue at the Betchlor Museum across the street. The next thing I know I am staring the menu at the best table in the house. (If you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is.) The light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations. The comfortable and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself.   I had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good when mixed together. My palate was very pleased and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty shell fell with the others. Happily in a coma after being satisfied by a taste I could only once wonder about I got myself the check. I didn't care how much it was, it was good, the service was astounding, and I was so comfortable at this point I could not even set a price on this kind of experience. Popped it open and to my surprise I walked out of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts.   After stumbling to the door trying to shake off my coma I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new adventure for my taste buds.
Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls, we had a reservation, waited 10 minutes to be seated, was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.    In the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time.
Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes.
Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disgusting. I honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life. From the frozen crab cakes to the unseasoned grouper.. my experience left me confused and hungry. This is simply a Marriott hotel restaurant - not an award winning restaurant by any means.
My boyfriend and I ended up getting food poisoning!  I was extremely disappointed, because the location is near our condo and the staff was so friendly!  I think we are going to the emergency room!
Not a lot to say other than great southern comfort food. Good fried chicken, great beef ribs. Small servings of ribs, but great flavor. Loved the collard greens and coconut cake. I'd go back. Definately worth trying.
I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it.
Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, d\u00e9cor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area.
Very unprofessional and rude employees...I would not recommend coming here unless you want the most expensive car wash, an oil change, and your gas tank filled for $0.20/gallon more than Cobblestone Auto Spa. I politely cancelled my wash (due to the badgering for upgrades and oil change) and the woman did not remove the writing on my window, just wiped two streaks through it and made a few comments under her breath. They then asked me to park my truck across the street while I go inside and pay for the gas they pumped while we were talking, then I was asked to come find her outside and bring her the receipt. Even though this location is close it is far from convenient. ..two thumbs down.
First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.  Second, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.  Third, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells.
I have to say, I was extremely disappointed when stopping in for lunch today.  My husband raved about Tom's lunch he had several months ago.  He said they had “killer” potato salad and a chili-mac-and-cheese you'd never find anywhere.  The 2 of us ordered; Prime Rib French Dip, Cuban Pork Sandwich and a BLT.  The French Dip was the worst of the 3.  Dry, very over cooked - crispy meat - nothing that we expected, a huge disappointment.  The Cuban Pork was mediocre at best.  The BLT - only okay at best.  I have to say the sides were a different story - the Cole Slaw is the best you may ever eat.  Fries - same, excellent.  The staff was very attentive, hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly.  I don't know what Tom's looked like prior to the remodel - I sure wish I would have made it to lunch before the remodel - we certainly will not go back.  $45.00 for 3 lunches and one soda - not worth it.
Finally, thanks to the reviews on yelp, I've found a mani/pedi place that I like, reasonable prices, clean, prompt and good.  I've had Tran twice now and have been happy both times. I like my nails to be oval/natural - no dragon lady nails for me.  I have been all over Central Phoenix for my toes and fingers -  disappointed in most of the places I went.  Really happy with Tran and DV nails.
Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.  On a recent Thursday night, my friend and I had possibly the worst waitress ever.  Her name was Amanda and this is my story about her as our waitress.  She was not present for about 15 minutes after we were sat.  She finally appeared and asked us for our drink order. She disappeared for about 10 minutes before returning.  She served us our drinks then immediately left for another table. It was another 5 to 10 minutes before she came by again, this time taking our order for food.  She return 5 minutes later with another round of drinks which we don't remember ordering, but we weren't going to complain. We never saw her the rest of the night.  Other waitresses were making their rounds every 5 minutes out on the patio, but ours never appeared once.  I thought she may have died in back in the kitchen or was burned beyond recognition.  I even asked one of the other waitresses out of concern for her safety if she was okay.  She said they would check.  She returned not long after and said she was alright.  I relaxed a little, until another 15 minutes went by... it was now about 30 minutes since we had ordered and no food.  We waited a bit longer, we still hadn't seen Amanda (our waitress for those paying attention).  An hour went by and we had had enough. I really couldn't believe this.  Not only did we not have our food, but we hadn't seen our waitress in an hour.  An hour.  What the hell?
I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a “welcome” packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!
We just received the worst service ever I will never come back. Its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables. One person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks. We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out, his response was unprofessional.  :(
The Housemade Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich is as good as it gets in the sandwich world.
This is a small, shabby-chic French restaurant serving simple french food.  The style of cooking is from the Brittany region of France (in the North) and hardier, less complex, and less delicate than the stereotypical French cuisine.  The menu is small is its a little more expensive than the average place in CU but the food we ate was tasty, filling, and a nice change.  I recommend the salmon starter and specials.  Service was relaxed and friendly but not slow.  My parents both enjoyed the coffee.
Leased a car for the first time and could not have picked a better business to work with. Josh Plummer, Meredith Cameron, Andrew Treanor and the rest of the staff made this an incredibly easy experience and my wife and I are driving a brand new CT. Life is good!

When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me, Casbah's prix fixe menu really jumped off the page! Since the Big Burrito group is so popular, I was happy to get reservations, especially since a lot of times were already booked.  The hubby and I arrived a few minutes early for dinner. I had planned additional time to park and was delightfully reminded that Big Burrito restaurants have free valet parking -- so great, especially with slushy snow on the ground! Even though we were a few minutes early, the hostess took our coats and seated us immediately.    Service was extremely attentive from start to finish. Waters were re-filled quickly. Bread was brought to the table almost immediately and we were offered another basket as soon as we finished the first. The bread came with a delicious spread - was it goat cheese? - that I just couldn't stop eating. Silverware whisked away with each course was promptly replaced.  We ordered both the land and sea courses to share so we could try the entire NYE prix fixe menu. None of the eight dishes disappointed! The first courses were Sea Scallops & Octopus and Duck Confit. The sea scallop was perfectly cooked, the octopus - thought not my cup of tea! - was also well cooked, and the balsamic flavor in the dish was very tasty. I absolutely loved the duck confit dish. It was served with mustard greens and fruit with a to-die-for dressing - a delicious combination!  The second courses were Potato Gnocchi and Mushroom Tortelloni. The gnocchi was served with lobster, which was a unique but nice paring. Though a strongly flavored dish, the tortelloni was delicious, and I enjoyed another unique paring, tortelloni with chunks of beef short rib.  Lake Ontario Walleye and Roasted Veal Strip Loin were the third courses. Both were cooked to perfection. The walleye's skin was perfectly crispy, and the veal strip loin was cooked medium well but was still deliciously juicy and tender. However, a component of each dish was disappointing -- a mustard flavor in the walleye and pickled mustard seeds covering the veal. I really can't hold this against Casbah though. I'm just not a fan of mustard!  Finally, the desserts was fantastic! The Chocolate Ganache Tart was the ending of the sea courses. The chocolate was strong, even a little bitter, and was served with a little champagne strawberry compote. I grew more accustomed to the bitterness with each bite, and it was the perfect ending to three courses filled with fish. A Caramel Macaroon completed the land courses. The macaroon was delicious and served with a little apple sorbet and caramel sauce.  Our experience at Casbah was spectacular! Based on this experience, I debated giving the restaurant five stars... but decided to wait until I returned a second time. And I can't wait to return!
BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on “PA n'at with Dave and Dave” and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a “Battleship” and it was literally 3 feet long, just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.    It's great, fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship.
I have been a long time fan but after having a issue with an item I purchased online this Christmas I will not be shopping here again. I tried to take a item back with the packing slip that came on the item, the associate told me I was unable to do the return with the packing slip but she could do it if I had the email confirmation.. I didn't have it on my phone so I went.. I found the email sent it back to my phone and tried the return again.. todays associate told me I could not do the return with the confirmation email but needed the packing slip.. which I could not find at the time. I asked to speak with the manager on duty which the associate called.. Valencia the manager on duty would not come up to speak with me but told the associate that they couldn't do the return.. I still have this 100.00 worth of stuff I don't need.. I would not recommend anyone from purchasing from Kmart!
I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago, I was just out of college with no money and didn't care what I ate.  So I spent a lot of time eating bar food, pizza, and $1 pierogies.  I never knew there were “fancy” restaurants until I returned this week for work!  I got the salad with pears & gouda which was delicious with a ton of cheese.  I also had the octopus appetizer as a meal - I was surprised, it's much chewier than I expected.  But the vinaigrette on it was tasty and the red potatoes and kalamata olives gave it a lot of flavor.  The fruity sorbet was good as well.    I though the service was great and the waiters didn't laugh at me for not knowing half the words on the menu.  They were more than willing to explain!
The Sicilian Pizza is huge, tasty, crusty on the outside, soft in the middle.  The regular thin crust pizza was loaded with toppings.  My only complaint is that the Pizza was served luke warm.  I want my pizza piping hot, almost burning the roof of my mouth!  The overall taste made up for the temperature difference, and I was happy with the overall experience.  Both the cooks and the waitress were friendly.
This is one of those places where I only go if someone else REALLY wants to go. i always get the same thing, a chicken melt with onions and peppers. I could make it better, but it's been reliable. I am not an egg person, so I guess I am missing out? Coffee is not good. Usually crowded, and service is passable.
I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap pizza delivered.  This location however is awful.  They have messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the order arrives well over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was rude and told me “not to worry about it.” What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they delivered a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How does one make the online order THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap.
I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week.   We showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos.
Be sure to ask if your car is ready yet. They forget to announce it sometimes and leave you in the lobby waiting for Christmas.
Cons: * Very cramped space, aisles are so narrow that you have to carry your case sideways. * Only a few items were priced with signs hanging above them. * No shopping carts.  Pros: * Decent selection * Chilled section
One of my favorite places to eat.   Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good.
Our wedding cake and dessert table vendor was included in our reception package so I'm sure the owners are going to say we didn't pay them directly so what I write doesn't matter (I've seen this response in other negative reviews).  In my opinion, that should not matter.  We should still receive the same type of respect, courtesy and professionalism that all clients *should* receive.  This was not the case.  I won't rewrite what I posted last year about our issues with the dessert table and the attitude of Linda, but what I am posting about now is our 1 year anniversary cake top.  We were given a certificate in our package for a free, fresh cake made in our *wedding cake flavors.*  Linda even wrote the flavors on the card.  I was really excited to taste the cake since my husband and I didn't really get a chance to during our reception.  They gave us a plain chocolate cake with white icing.  This is not what our wedding cake was.  When I called and asked if there was a mistake I was told someone would call me back.  Of course, they didn't.  So, I called again and spoke with Steve who LAUGHED at me when I asked why we didn't receive a cake in our wedding flavors and then had the audacity to say 'well, you got a free cake.'  Really?!  It wasn't good and it was a plain cake I could have made myself.  When I said 'that's not the point' he said 'what do you want me to do?!  Another cake, fine.  When do you want to pick it up?'  When we picked up the second cake, again, in was the SAME cake as before.  I have yet to try my own wedding cake flavor.  They are so rude, cocky and ignorant.  I will *never* go to the bakery again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.
Port Authority (formerly known as PATransit, or “PAT”) operates a fairly extensive network of buses and (in the South Hills) light rail. Instead of running school buses, the school district gave high schoolers bus passes to get to class, and I have used the bus since 1997.  I've had a great experience using the bus in Pittsburgh. I didn't get a driver's license until I was almost 19--the bus (“Miss Pat”--another nickname) and my bike got me everywhere I needed to go. There will inevitably be delays and problems, but that is common to all modes of transportation. The price is right (especially with a “free” bus pass; students see below) and if you live and work in the city, you should consider making the bus your main means of commuting.  The system is largely built on the legacy of pre-World War II trolley lines, so the neighborhoods that were developed before 1950 are fairly well-served, while more recent developments can be harder to navigate by bus. The system just had a major overhaul (in spring 2010) but still travel many of the same routes.  The route numbering system is complicated, and there are many exceptions, but as a rule, the routes are numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion from downtown. The “oughts” and 10's go north, the 20's and 30's go west, the 40's and 50's go south, and the 60's, 70's, 80's an 90's go east. Routes that are just letters are express or flyer routes, which may go on one of three “busways,” transit-only highways that bypass traffic jams. The light rail (known as the “T” or the trolley) serves southern city and suburban neighborhoods above ground, and has three underground stations downtown, with a major construction project underway to extend trains to the North Side, projected for completion in 2011.  The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (among others) have agreements with the Port Authority to allow students, staff and faculty to use their university IDs as bus passes. Others can purchase passes at $75 per month or $20 per week, while a local one-way fare is $2.00. Port Authority is supposed to be rolling out a “smart card” digital payment system (\u00e0 la WMATA's SmarTrip or London's Oyster) soon, but that remains in development.  One especially great value is the 28X, a route serving the Pittsburgh International Airport from Downtown and Oakland (the university district) via the West Busway. Fare, as of mid-2010, is $2.75, compared with taxis and other shuttles costing $30 or more. The 28X runs every half hour and takes around 35 minutes to get to the airport from downtown, or 15 minutes longer from Oakland.  The Port Authority's fare revenues cover only a fraction of its expenses, and the state and county's perennial budget problems have caused several funding crises in recent years.
Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves, but they denied my request to return it. I am so angery at this and will never shop their chothes anymore.
Hand's down this place is my favorite store in Phoenix.  Actually, it's my favorite store in Arizona.  I would be hard pressed to find a place cooler than this that caters so exactly to my every need and desire as a baker.  I first came here when I was searching for a place to find cupcake liners in bulk.  I had just received an order from the school I work at to do cupcakes for their homecoming.  400 of them to be exact.  Ordering liners online would prove to be too pricey as would buying out every store's stock.  Somehow, even though I have driven by many many times, I did not even know this existed.  Now I certainly do.  Inside you will find a menagerie of things to delight everyone from the amateur baker to the professional pastry chef.  You will see rows of sprinkles, hundreds of cookie cutters, a rainbow of food coloring, dozens of specialty cake pans, and cake toppers galore.  I have never gone here and walked out unsatisfied.  I always find what I need.    If I could walk around this place with a plate of bacon from Matt's, I would seriously think I had died and gone to heaven.  If you are ever in need of anything related to cakes and cake decorating, give this place a shot.  You will never consult a big box craft store for your needs ever again.
The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?
The staff was so RUDE! 1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime Fri night. We came back about 20 min later. Different door guy and some old ladies who would not let us in, said we had to each pay $10. The place was ghetto and empty. We went back to Bar Smith (next door) who had much nicer staff, no cover, great drinks & drink prices, and awesome music. Sorry Sky Lounge, you suck.
Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.    I agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.)   You'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.    The place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty.
Just went to the pirate exhibit this weekend and I want to write a review because it was by far the coolest one yet.  I have been to the body exhibit, the titanic exhibit and others there.  Of course there is more to do there than just that for the kids, they blow stuff up at the lab, they have tons of cool little sections with things to do.  It is not cheap but we got the annual pass for the exhibits this year since we did the maze and we wanted to come back for the pirate and the Van Gogh exhibit coming next.  Now back to the pirate exhibit, holy cow they had a real life pirates treasure at the end that was valued at 400 million dollars!  The have tons of real “pieces of 8” they also recovered the bell from the original ship they found off the cost of Cape Cod.  There was their silverware, belt buckles, guns, cannons, gold, silver, rope, and I can go on forever.  It was just super cool to hear the story and see all the real life stuff.  This is not just a kid exhibit and in fact I spent much more time reading things and my kids blew right through it.
Mike n Molly's is a great time for those looking to enjoy the variety that Champaign-Urbana has to offer. The gigs are almost always entertaining and the staff is very responsive and friendly. It's a nice place to go with a small group of friends and have a few, or even dance on Saturdays. As a college student, I think it's fantastic for my new friends that Mike n Molly's lets them in at 19+, because it's a real bitch finding other bars that do that.
I use to like Ulta. At least, I think I did. I often went to the Ulta at MetroCenter before it closed, and when it did, I had no choice but to start visiting this Ulta. If it were not for the specific makeup I needed I wouldn't bother coming here. The customer service is non-existent. These so-called makeup artists or whatever they are, shouldn't even exist. To this day, not one of them has ever offered to help me when I go to the store. They stare at me when I walk by but continue chattering away to each other, or seek out the one blonde in the store. I walk in, pick up what I need and get the heck out of there.   The stuff is overpriced. You can get the drugstore brands of makeup for way cheaper anywhere else. The coupon thing is a joke. The points are a waste. Spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush?! Are you kidding?!
Me and my wife have a membership to the zoo - and well - would totally recommend it to everyone.  we use it all the time - heck i would go every week if she would let me.  there is just something about sitting at the zoo - in the weather - with the people  - enjoying the day.  not all animals look happy there, or comfortable for that matter, but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo.  it is a huge zoo - it would take most the day to see all of it.  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave.  we have been where we didn't see anyone for 20 minutes, and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems.  the zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money - you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you - opportunity cost eh.  my current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner - and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana.  it is like my crack.  some people sit by the pool and relax - i site by the savana and relax
My favorite pizza in the city. Hoagies are also pretty good but the pizza takes the spotlight. One of the best places to shoot pool in the south hills next door, what more do you need?
Having grown up in North Carolina, I've had lots of Barbecue (and I also smoke my own).  I feel I can adequately judge the quality of BBQ.  This particular establishment was unique in that it's right off the side of a highway and has drive-in microphones and ordering stations straight out of the 50's.  I did feel a little uneasy in the parking lot as it was in a shady part of town, but not a big deal.  I ordered the 1/4 Barbecue chicken meal and substituted potato salad for the slaw and onion rings for the fries.  In addition I ordered a “Minced” barbecue sandwich, which is the classic barbecue that people would think of when talking about North Carolina style BBQ.     First let me say that FoodNetwork came to this establishment for the unique nature of the 50's style drive-in and for the unique way that the pieces of barbecue chicken are prepared.  They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce.  I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.  It was “okay” but I wouldn't say it is anything to specifically come here for.    As for the barbecue, it is also “okay;” I can safely say that the meat is not smoked (there is no smoke rising from the kitchen, so I don't see how that could happen).  In addition, the meat itself lacked the distinctive smoky flavor characteristic of good, slow cooked North Carolina barbecue.  The sandwich overall was ever so slightly more typical of NC BBQ than what I received from Mac's (which was very overcooked and completely lacked flavor), but unfortunately I would never recommend the restaurant for NC barbecue or otherwise.
I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all.
This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town.   I don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+
I lived in Pittsburgh for four years and have never been to D's, but I visited recently and went with some friends. What lured me was the promise of veggie dogs and burgers, and I was not let down. I got two hot dogs--a Chicago and a mac and cheese. Really, really good. My boyfriend ordered the Red Alert dog (his was meat) and his face basically melted off, but he insisted he loved it. Then he said the spices may or may not have traveled to his tear ducts, but to each his own. He had a great time. My two friends also got the mac and cheese veggie dog and loved it.  The beer cave is awesome.  I'd love to give D's five stars, but like a couple of people mentioned, the service is lacking. Everyone is friendly, but I had to walk around and find our server so I could pay, and then find him again when he didn't return. It took us a while to get water refills, too. The dining area and the bar are separated, and it seems like the servers congregate in one place and leave the other vacant at any given time. Very nice people though.
Super cute dive bar with friendly staff and patrons.  Cheap drinks, darts and a jukebox are entertaining.  Loved it!
Jeff P has it all right. I've been going to AABC for a really long time, and they've always been my favorite shop.   The owners are always up to help you, and the staff is excellent. No matter if I'm in 1 time every 6 months, or every week, Eddie always has my books pulled and he knows my box # by memory. I don't even know my box number.  I've been going to AABC exclusively for years, and I see no reason to change.  Atomic is trying too hard, and they don't care about you. Samurai is good, but not my style. They are great for indie and anime, but I'm a Marvel guy.
I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!
I haven't found Thai food that blew me away in Pittsburgh, but the waiter here was incredibly friendly, and my mock duck dish was solidly tasty.
I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.    I figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man, was I wrong.  The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor.   Spoiled by the fresh ingredients and catches of California, I felt like the ingredients were sort of old.  Considering I went in on a Saturday, I figured it might be better but it wasn't at all.  The service was good.  That's the justification for the 2 stars.  Otherwise, I really wouldn't recommend this place to other people.
Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward.   When I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us.
It seems like every other time I take my pets to Point Breeze there is an unnecessary frustration.   From being berating for using their online prescription program to being misquoted prices substantially to poor customer service I just keep hoping each time will be better.  Although I know they love animals I suspect they love money more.  Dr. Caroline. Simard is an excellent vet, but my last two visits have been pushed to other vets whose bedside manner is atrocious.   I'm a 40 year-old  who has been taking my pets to vets since childhood and I don't understand why each visit leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
This place is the worst.  Of course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live.  Every time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next. And God forbid they catch your child with a Goldfish cracker in the kids section...off with their heads!  Additionally, once it was off limits to Savoy/Mahomet residents, I felt unwelcome there and totally uncomfortable.  I do have a grad student friend who had her feet slightly outside her sandals and got yelled at for it. Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes?  And the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there. I thought that was the point of a library? To excite people about reading and give FREE ACCESS TO ALL.  Champaign “Public” library (which it really isn't anymore) is truly the most unfriendly library I have ever been to and I will never go back there again.
My wife's Mini Cooper had to have its engine replaced. She no longer felt comfortable driving that car. We visited Nissan, Honda, Toyota and VW dealerships and ultimately had the best experience with Zimbrick VW in Middleton. Otto was very helpful. He was not pushy and gave us all the information we needed to make a decision.  Zimbrick made a very fair offer to trade in the Mini but we ended up selling it ourselves. Once my wife's car was sold, Otto made the process very quick and easy so we had her in her new Passat the same day. He even stayed after closing to walk her through setting up her new car!  When I replace my Toyota RAV4, I will definitely consider Zimbrick VW.
Bad wash as usual and NO customer service. Now they expect you to do what they can do in 30 seconds (change my new license plate number in their system) - now the customer has to go online and do it. Convenient yes - but never going back!!! The good news is they get you in and out quickly, the bad news is the quality of the wash leaves little to be desired and they beat you up for everything from windshield repair to oil changes to details and so on. After many years, I have had enough!!!
The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn't give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks.
I'll cut right to the tender, juicy heart of Longhorn...its a great chain steakhouse, and as far as I am concerned, it puts Outback to shame.  Their STEAK and SERVICE are just flat-out better in my mind than Outback.  I am not an Outback hater or anything, its just than when I tell people about Longhorn, the response I usually get is, “Why don't you just go to Outback??”  Well here's what keep's me coming back to Longhorn instead...  *Steaks are always juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  I've never had a bad or less than satisfactory steak at Longhorn.  I usually order the 7oz. Flo's Filet.  Don't worry, 7oz. of quality steak is more than what you think, and is more than enough for most people (see pics).    *I love the Crab and Lobster dip (see pics).  I order this almost every time I go here.  I don't know if the crab and lobster are imitation or not, and to be honest, I really don't care.  All I know, is that it is a stellar appetizer and puts the overrated Blooming onion to shame as far as appetizers go.  *I love the mash-potatoes.  I just wish they would cut back on the butter a little bit.  I mean we all love butter, but no one's trying to sacrifice their life for it.  I recommend asking for lite butter on the mash-potatoes if you choose to order them as a side to go with your entree.  *I love the brown bread that they serve before the meal.  It's good, but it's better when its warm and fresh, and I've had some non-fresh bread before.  I can't say that the bread is consistently better than Outback's.  *The service is always top-notch.  Everyone from the hostess, to the manger to the servers are extremely friendly and polite.  Drinks are always promptly refilled and orders are always correct.    *They do serve a few select beers on draft such as Bud Light and Blue Moon, but beware, they aren't cheap and can turn a reasonably priced dinner into an expensive one very quickly.  In recent visits, I have tried to stay away from the alcoholic beverages while there.    There's nothing NOT to like about Longhorn.  Reasonable prices, great food, and awesome service...what else do you need?
Should have listened to the numerous negative reviews on-line (and there were many) but we trusted Guy from Diners, Drivins & Dives ...BIG MISTAKE.   Clue #1 Strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting “Food Network” endorsement. Clue #2  Self serves sign-in waiting list, apparently, the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones.  Misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the 10-20min 104 degree wait more bearable.   The minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs,cups & utensils we were in trouble. One waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant, which was a complete zoo. Now according to Triple D, the pasta was homemade....aaaaaah.....not so much.... Ive been to Italy, I know the difference.    Cut to the chase, $27.00 for two a la carte / appetizer sized entrees.  Seems to me, his only goal is cashing in on the TV appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business...  Don't waste your time and money....On a positive note, Guy was right about Matts Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, great good and the best costumer service we've ever had.
I have given this place multiple tries now and finally have decided to give it a proper review. General Tso's is my go to dish for Chinese take out, an this place failed miserably on that! Nothing but over cooked chicken with a lot of sauce and breading and yucky skin. Yuck. The lo mien was also horrible. There was just no flavor what so ever and nothing but noodles and what looked to be whatever mysterious vegetable they had lying around.  If I wanted to order leftover's I would order leftover's!  There saving grace is their hot sour soup. Very tasty. But...... I had one bad experience with it where I ordered a large to go and instead of telling me they only had enough for a small container, they put the left over/bottom of the pot in and filled it up only 3/4 of the way. Talk about shady service! I even watched them do it from behind the counter. Trying to pull a fast one on me. I think NOT!  I'm still giving it a solid 2 stars because their egg rolls and ragoon were at least tasty too (other than the tasty soup, that is when they have it available). But in all honestly, nothing special. I can go to any Chinese take out joint and get the same thing any day of the week.   So yeah.....If you want good Chinese. this is not the place I recommend. If you want quick Chinese just because your craving it....well maybe rethink it or just settle for the China Inn.
The straight dope:  4.5 star bar for hopheads and craft brew fans:  Not particularly extensive in terms of number of offerings, but some sincere thought was put into the list and the result is a spectacular night's worth of excellent brew sampling.  Well done!  It would be nice if they had 12-year Yamazaki single malt to really put the cherry on top of their Japanese theme (even Benihana has that), and that would probably double my frequency of visits, but I guess they have plenty of the ordinary mid to top shelf liquors.     4.25 star ambience/decor.  Dark and modern.  Just how I like it.   4 star sushi/sashimi:  Our party of six tried about six rolls.  Nothing was left on the plates when we were done.  I found the quality to be high, but the execution and taste forgettable.  My wife would certainly disagree - she had the “Senorita Roll” on her mind for many days after we went there, and she went back again 2x over the span of 2 weeks just to get it.  4.25 star dishes and appetizers:  The spicy riblets are INSANE.  One would think that a chef would be a bit fearful of putting something out that is so intentionally overcooked and brittle...but it works!  And I think that is what is special about Moto...the menu has a nice dash of daring, unconventional twists on what could have been (and often is) just very ordinary fare at other places.    PS - the portion sizes of some dishes (like yakisoba) are HUGE - two people could easily be satisfied by one entree here, so if you attend with a group, don't be afraid to “underorder” a bit and to share it family-style.
The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable, the dresses came back perfect,  and the length in time getting them back was very fast. Is recommend this shop for any and all alterations.
Great spot for weird or obscure parts, general maintenance items, and to  borrow a wrench or two.  Gerry is like a wise eccentric uncle.   I remember going there for my first time in the early 90's and it hasn't changed in almost 20 years.
Called this morning after I noticed my outside spigot was leaking and frozen.  Stan was very friendly and sent a team within 30 minutes.  The two guys who arrived were great and finished the repair quickly.  The talked to me in advance of doing any work and even provided cost estimates. Discussed options were and helped me decide the best course.  The cost was reasonable and I will definitely call again if I need plumbing work. Thanks - Christine
I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.
Close to work yet I think I will keep walking.  I've been there for breakfast and lunch and it's ok.  I tried their spicy peanut slaw, and all you can taste is sriracha and nothing else, bleh!  I couldn't eat it, it was not flavorful just a burning heat. Sandwiches are ok, nothing to really jump and down about.
Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?
THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss this place, but having heard so much about it from my local pizza-loving friends about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  The sauce definitely isn't for everyone - it's a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap that everyone has gotten used to.  But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high volume of business.  The pepperoni reminds me of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely not the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete with the relic-style pizza box.  It's not in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!
Wait 20 mins to get a parking spot then wait 15 for a machine no thanks. Just cancelled and move to Fitness Connection for $10 bucks a month. For that price I can go to a swanky yoga studio on the weekends and still be cheaper than the Y. This place is seriously over sold. Stop selling more memberships when you don't have enough space or equipment to accommodate current members. Serious over crowding issue.
We had to be near downtown today, and when scrolling through nearby restaurants on my phone I saw this one.  On Google it's rated 5 stars.  Here it's 4 stars.  And only a single dollar sign!  So we drove over.  The place looks like something you might find in Mexico.  No hostess.  Walk up to the counter, order your food, wait for your number to be called, walk into the dining area (ducking under a low arch if you over 6' tall) where you are greeted with basic tables and chairs.  Seriously...if you didn't know you were in Phoenix you'd swear you were in an eatery in Mexico.  They also have a bakery and a market attached to the food counter.  On to the actual food.  As this was my first time here I ordered the chimi.  I usually do that so I have a basis for comparison to other places.  My wife had the albondigas soup.  We both liked our dishes.  The chimi was done perfectly.  A light crunch of the shell.  Not overcooked, not greasy.  The chicken was moist and tender.  And it was a pretty big chimi.  I think one does need to add some pico to it because the chicken's seasoning was very mild.  The pico added just a bit of flavor that really made the difference.  And the Mexican rice was very nice.  I wish it wasn't so far from home (Gilbert) because I'd love to make this my “regular” spot for Mexican food.  I would say it blows away just about every place else I've found in the Valley, and is neck-and-neck with Guerrero's (in Tempe).  I can't choose between the two at this moment.  I hope to return here, and will be trying something different.  Their menu is pretty extensive with several traditional dishes (including menudo, lengua, and albondigas).
Fabulous place!!!   Went during Queens Feast Restaurant week and it was very organized and accommodating . Food and staff could not be better! Definitely will come back!
We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.  The location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.  My biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were thin; we could hear our neighbor's dog barking, as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.  Overall, for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show), it was fine. But with the thin walls, expensive parking, and the dirty bathroom, i'd never stay at this place again. I've had better experiences in smaller, cheaper hotels.
As someone who manages a bar, I generally keep an open mind going into a new place. That was quickly closed when the owner of the bar came absolutely unglued, using obscene language and profanities towards our group. After her tirade of foul language and threatening gestures she then told us to leave or she'd have us arrested. Mind you this is the woman who was threatening physical violence against us not 10 minutes before. If you'd like to be treated as a CUSTOMER, and not a whipping pole, I'd suggest ANY other bar. If you'd like to be treated like absolute garbage by a raging alcoholic, head on in.  The bar tenders were ok, but clearly not fast paced enough to handle our group of 12.
Salami and cheese is so amazing. Best food in the city!
They're a great local alternative to Starbucks, and they make kickass drinks! I've had mochas here, hot and cold, and chai tea lattes here, hot and cold. All were delicious, about the same price as you would find at Starbucks, but they have those cute little stickers for decorating your cup and I'm all about the stickers. They're usually seasonally themed and are always adorable. It's the little things, people.
Replacing an unsuccessful print and framing shop on the corner of 35th and North Davidson, tattoo artist and native Charlottean Joey Vernon has put together a shop full of phenomenal artist  with Fu's Custom Tattoo's that has become one of the busiest businesses in the NoDa neighborhood in the last year.  The non-inked can cringe and marvel at the artistry with the window booth on gallery crawls while fans of skin art can get tattooed in the open and social set up throughout the rest of the shop.  Or they can swing in and scope out the adjacent Baku art gallery that houses some of the ink houses' artists' canvas works beyond the skin.  In my thirteen some odd years of being tattooed, and having sat for five different artist, this is one of the most laid back and social tattoo parlors that I have graced.  It makes for a very comfortable setting during what can prove to be a somewhat uncomfortable experience.  Old school traditional, japanese, black work, et cetera.  They have a stable of more than competent artist that can either translate the artwork you bring with you or create a one of a kind piece to last a lifetime.  I have sat with Matt Terry who is insanely good and look forward to having Joey work on me in the not too distant future...
So, I had to play hotel switcheroo because Hyatt's rate seemingly tripled for one night in the middle of my stay. I wound up here and I think I'm officially done with Choice Hotels forever. I've never had a positive experience aside from this one Econo Lodge in Walterboro, SC.  This hotel is located in the middle of a vast array of garbage food restaurants. If you want to go to a grocery store, they're all 15 minutes away. While the hotel might be convenient to some attractions, it isn't convenient to things an everyday hotel guest would need or want unless you like McDonald's and Waffle House. Gross.  The beds are not comfortable at all and this hotel has resorted to using these god awful square 15” pillows. Who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child!? It's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on. Pair the lack of comfort with the 11:00 check out and you have one unhappy guest! I requested a late check-out time upon check-in as I advised I'd be working overnight. 12:30 was the best she could do as she made some kind of, apparently phantom note. The next morning at exactly 10:58, the phone rang and reminded me that I was scheduled to check out that day and that check out was 11:00. Blah, so much for sleeping inn at Sleep Inn.  The hotel is quite noisy as it borders I-77 and the immediate area isn't all that great. Noise from other guests was relatively nil though.  The mini freezer and mini fridge were nice, but it didn't make up for the overall room quality. The hotel WiFi averages 10 Mbps down/5 Mbps up and is complimentary.  Not recommended and officially denied going forward.
Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .
Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)  Maybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well.
Not again A few simple items turned into a large bill. I thought the charges were excessive and questionable services  that they stated I needed. I unfortunatey did not have time for my routine mechanic, thought this would be convienent with work location. shopper beware Not again for me.
Dam I wish I would have known this place was here sooner. Really good sandwiches. They use Boars Head meat which I am a huge fan of. They have so many different sandwiches it took me a while to figure out what I wanted. The menu is kinda all over the place. There is a menu board but its old and fadeed but they have white papers with all the sandwiches hung up all over the wall. The staff  are very friendly and I'm sure this place has many regulars. Inside its a tight squeeze with limited seating. The macaroni salad is great as is the potatoe salad. I love the sicilian sub. The italian dressing on it is so really good and I think thats why I like this sub so much. My other fav is the club on wheat. Oh yeah I think Ill go there agin today. Sanwhiches range from $5.95-6.95.
Service was not good, they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale.
Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?  The building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!
Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy, dirty, poorly renovated and the WORST customer service known to man. The way I was treated by the front desk was enough reason to never step foot within a mile radias of this place. Doesn't even deserve one star in my book.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure.
Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.  A co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.  I got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.  I won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.
Wonderful restaurant and very friendly wait staff.  I made reservations and was seated promptly.  The grilled salmon was made to perfection and the flirtini's were great.  I actually met a quality guy there as well.  ;)  Overall, the experience was awesome.  Very nice restaurant, good food, friendly staff, valet was a bit slow, but overall a good time and worth the money.
I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating, I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us, and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant, so this is the main reason for a 2, hopefully it's a rarity because the food was pretty good. I had the Cod sandwich , it was hot and tasty, probably one of the better fish sandwiches I've had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!
I have had the baked Chicken (Thursday special) and it is WONDERFUL!. A great change from all the chain and fast food restaurants downtown. It does get very crowded and little awkward when it is that way.  The food comes fast and is delicious. I have only been here for weekday lunches, usually Thursday. My coworkers love the other specials too.  If you are looking for a change from the everyday, this place is a great one to start!
This place was highly recommended by our friends and we were hoping to also like it. First off, I called and asked if I could bring a small birthday cake for my husband's birthday. The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service.
My family and I have had our Phoenix zoo membership for 1 year now. We love it! It is worth every penny. We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home.   We watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all.   We love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat.   Now, I must say... If you have been to the San Diego zoo, please realize that the Phoenix Zoo can not compare. So, don't go to the Phoenix Zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes. But, it is the 2nd best zoo I have been to.   My family is from a small city in Arizona. We moved to Phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children. I chose to live in S. Scottsdale specifically because the Phoenix zoo is about 2 miles away from my home.
Service: I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four. He gave his recommendation and I went with it. Got the meal home and we only have 1 mac and cheese, 1 potato salad 5 rolls. Now, this wasn't some big Styrofoam container. It was just enough for one person. The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed.   Food: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed “Have seconds!” The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular.   Overall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away. I just made some ribs tonight on the grill and I thought they were better than Honey's.  If you're craving bbq, then this will get you out of a pinch. But if you want the “Slap yo momma” type grub, then make an about face.
An Arizona elite institution.  High academic and artistic standards. Quite challenging for students. Teachers are unusually highly communicative.
There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!  Now the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every, yes every, bath towel had a stain (either black or yellow). There was stained grout behind the toilet like it had leaked sometime in the past. Even the shower curtain was stained. Then there was the hair dryer. It was sooooo sticky that I didn't even want to touch it. It appeared to be covered in about 15 years worth of cheap hairspray.   I can appreciate that the hotel is getting older and may need a renovation soon, but come on people!  How about you splurge and replace your bath towels and hair dryers now!    Let me be clear that I think the cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they have been given. They just need a better starting product!
As a chinese american college student from NYC who got stuck in Pittsburgh with its useless public transportation (circa 1998), I desperately missed home-style Chinese food for the better part of my first two years here. Things turned around for me once I got a car (or made friends with cars), but I was seriously hurting for a while.  Tasty was one of the places we found. Back in the day, it was owned and ran by a typical restaurant-owning Chinese family. They had the works - pushy lao ban niang (boss lady), chef slash dad, and, during school off-hours, junior high school daughter manning the cashier. If they were in NYC, they'd only be missing an ami.... a bus boy. The food was pretty good, and if you order in Chinese, the lao ban niang hooked you up with extras because “your parents teach you good to talk Chineees”.   I'm pretty sure Tasty is under new ownership now. The food isn't as good as it was, but the restaurant still gives off the home-style look and feel. It's a small restaurant with enough seating for about 25-30 patrons. Cheap tables, cheap seats; after all, restaurant extras are just a waste of money. The customers should come back for the food, this *is* a restaurant.  The new waitress is not friendly, but she gets the job done. The food is still good - so if you're craving a home cooked meal, you'll be somewhat satisfied here. Don't expect grandma's cooking, though. Order the vegetables, the mapo tofu is good, beef/chicken chow fun, etc. They have a lot of other staple items on the menu too. Don't get the salted pork chops - save that craving for Orient Kitchen. Try things, and share your thoughts.  Tasty - it's more than your neighborhood take out joint.  - written by a former junior high school daughter cashier
I only had Pho so I can't judge the rest of the food, but the Pho was the worst I've ever had. Biggest let down ever, as I drove here once and it was closed and came back excited to get my fill of Pho at what's apparently the best place in Pittsburgh, but  left feeling sad. The broth tasted like water, and amount of beef and noodles you get was pathetic.
LOVE the Etouffee! The chicken with rice and beans is amazing. I can't wait to go back. I love the casual feel and the food is just down right good.
Stopped by tonight with a friend. We both ordered bottled beers. My bottle came with a “Best consumed before May 11, 2011”. My friend's beer had a due date of November 8. I returned my beer and ordered a draft. The waiter did discount my order, but I was really disappointed in their quality control. Not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the whole experience left a bad taste.
Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many, many times. However it has a few years since I have been there and I had yet to play the new renovated course.  I have used the practice range a few times since the course reopened and like the new additions so I was excited to play the course again and see the new changes.  I was a little disappointed.  The carts are new Club Car's and they are equipped with a GPS featured that disables the golf cart if the driver takes the cart into an area where it should not be. I can certain understand how this is a good idea. However I think they have the settings a little too high.  If you approach the green from the wrong side the disable feature engages.  The cart paths are for the most part gone.  They are still in a temporary club house from 2 years ago.  I read in the paper that the management company that was awarded the contract to run the course is having some challenges.   That is an understatement.   So I guess this course will go down in my memory similar to the other Phoenix landmarks that are now gone.  Similar to the old Cine Capri Movie theater on 24th street.  I would rather remember Papago Golf Course as the great muni it was, rather then the course in disrepair that it is now.
Awesome church full of the spirit of God!
Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition.   We were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal.   Our waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.  The meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.  We ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces.   Then we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish.   The tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them.   Finally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it).   After that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.
Great customer service.  Convenient location.  Large assortment of games which is appreciated but the prices are a bit high. Minus the prices, I dig it.
I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.  I give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.  I think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.  I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here.
Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals, wood, fiber, mixed media and book/paper arts (beginning to advanced). They do a great job of hosting outside events and fundraisers.
I was in BAD need of a GOOD haircut.  I knew I wanted bangs, some layers, something cute and sexy..is that possible?  Yes it is when you have Kristina cut your hair!  Wow!  She was really great.  She took the time to educate me on what's best for my hair, different bang styles, etc etc.  Also, Kristina wasn't a Chatty Cathy...which I loved.  Sometimes I like to just sit in quiet and be alone with my thoughts.  She allowed me that space while still giving me pertinent information.  The only thing is that I would have liked to know up front what all the extras would have cost.  Shame on me for not asking though.  I already prebooked another appt with Kristina, that's how happy I am with my cut.
My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas. We ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.
Blow it out. The party's over. This candle has flickered and the flame has gone out. Wax on. Wax off. Closed. And for anyone who caught my stand up, yes indeed, I have purchased tapered candles here.
RUDE RUDE RUDE. I normally NEVER leave a review of a fast food chain, but this is an exception.  The workers are just plain rude.  The fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale.  Avoid this place unless you just don't give a crap about how your treated and want a sub par Big Mac.
When I lived a block from Pane Bianco, I used to make it a point to spend (and eat) as little as possible throughout the week just to be able to grab one of their sandwiches (preferably the mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich) on the weekend.  A little pricey, but worth every penny; the food is crafted so well that you start to dream about it and wonder when you can run back for more. If you're a coffee or tea fan, it's perfectly paired with Lux right next door; ample seating to eat your sandwich in peace and enjoy the people watching.
We ate at Christo's for the first time and enjoyed the old school vibe   Great food   Great wine. Great service at a very reasonable price. Would definitely return. Our waitress, Stacy and Jose made us feel like regulars.  Looking forward to dining there again.
We went here for lunch last week. The place is very small, cramped. They only have like 4 little tables that seat two people and one that sits four. The place was completely packed as it was lunch hour in the Galleria area. Service was slow and kinda confusing.  They were out of several items, specifically, cilantro, which was one of the main ingredients in Becky's sub. The problem wasn't that they were out, but that they failed to tell her this until the sub was in mid-production.  Mine was fine as far as production and taste but for a toasted sub, it was barely warm.  Not that this is their fault, as they only serve it, but stay away from the Honey Lemonade they have. It's disgusting.  The place was fairly clean and well stocked and organized. The staff were friendly. The two main sandwich guys spoke very little English so I had to repeat my order a couple of times to confused looks. To boot, they sandwich guys spoke different languages from each other so you can tell there was some confusion and even a little bickering back and forth. Not major, but noticeable.  Not awful, but they can improve.
I have been going to this IHOP every month for 4 years. Our group is anywhere from 8 to 25. There are only two places in the restaurant that accommodate groups and for the most part, we have been seated relatively quickly. Over the past year, service has gone down hill. It started taking forever to get our order taken, get our drinks, or get our food. We are a very forgiving bunch and know it's not easy to serve a large group but as service started really sliding, our last trip ended the relationship. We had about 20 people and knew we would have to wait a bit, but after 30 minutes, we inquired how long and it was like “your waiting for a table?”the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups. How can you not remember a group when they take up the whole lobby? We called a near by breakfast place and they were thrilled to have our party, which grew smaller since some left at that point. We found a new home and they will get 5 stars on my review.
slow service. The banana blueberry bead was so so. Rolls were so so.  Sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. Service was total poops.
Meh. If I have to choose between Chipotle and Qdoba, I would choose the former. Both places have ample seating area but when it comes to the taste, Chipotle is far more superior. Do yourself a favor and get something better.
Recently I visited a handful of international food stores in Champaign, IL. Far East Market was the most impressive among them. Their Produce selection was incredible. A short list includes mangos, banannas, Korean pears, luffa, eggplant, casava, clabaza squash, lotus root, galanga, plantain, daikon, dirion, and many more. There was a variety of mushrooms. They offer very fresh seafood. Other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine, canned jack fruit, pickled caggage, bamboo shoots, quail eggs, fried gluten, dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas. If you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods, this is likely your best bet. The grocery store is rustic and it almost feels as though you step into an inner city market in another country when you visit Far East Market. They take both checks and cash but do NOT accept credit.
The Good: -I liked the decor.  It was very pretty. -The “Soup of the Day” was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.  I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy. -Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list. -The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.  The Bad: -The waiter was not friendly.  He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever. -The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the “Tapa of the Day,” because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?! -I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.  It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice.  Blech!  The Ugly: -I got food poisoning.  Thank you, Korean Hot Pot.  My guts are still kvetching about you.  ...The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back.  If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score.  Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect.
Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..
I'm into these long winded reviews...don't have the time.   This place is not any good.  Don't waist your money.
I adore Prestogeorge. They've got a ton of freshly roasted coffees, which is great. Also? Lots and lots of loose-leaf tea. I may be willing to admit a small tea addiction, and this is one of my favorite places to try something new. I've given coffee and tea from here as gifts and they've always been well-received; it's especially nice that I can get whatever grind I'd like.  There's also a smallish selection of gourmet foods, and my husband likes some of the dips. Then again, he likes most dips.  My favorite, favorite thing here, though, is the staff. I always end up stopping here and buying SOMETHING when I'm in the Strip, because they're amazingly friendly and more than willing to help with any questions. When people go on and on about “back in the day, the mom and pop stores really took care of you blah blah fishcakes,” this is the kind of service I imagine.
Phew, where to start with this place!!!!!!????   This review is from a 1 time dinner experience on a Saturday.   The ambience is excellent.  Comfortable seating, spacious, and beautifully decorated.  Fun crowd that is business casual.   Our service was excellent.  Really personable, made some solid recommendations and just really pleasant.    The food was INCREDIBLE.  Let me spare your time and tell you that if you a very fresh tasting seafood dish whether it be sushi or oysters...go here.  Presentation is great, portion size is nice, flavors outstanding.    Overall, one of my best meals ever.
I've stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality.  There was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day I waited 30 minutes to check in.  As a result, I didn't have time to go up to the room before leaving for dinner.  They said that my bags would be delivered to my room but when I got back at 10:30 p.m., ready to collapse, they were no where to be found.  There was standing water in the tub and the shower head was only partially working.  Not the kind of experience I expect from a hotel where there are additional fees for everything - I'm talking $15 for one day of parking!    I have high standards for this place since my previous stays have been great.  Why are you slacking Westin Charlotte?
Nice atmosphere. Cheeseburger was not all that.
I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
The smell, the vibe and feel as soon as I opened my car door was apparent. This is very Asian for the likes of pretty much every street corner in parts of LA. I only wish we had a more concentrated ethnic specific area beyond south Phoenix like LA.. or any other city for that matter. Hell, look at the Asian part of town in Vegas, its awesome!
Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly.   Bottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.  Park rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.  Wear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipster's Flickr!
Boy do I miss Primate Bros.  I remember going there when the packing district was coming alive at 3 and 4 a.m.  We were coming back from a night of being out 'n about with friends (this was in high school/college summers in the mid-70's).  We would order wild concoction in sandwiches with french fries IN them.  I liked the place so much I bought and wore proudly one of their T-shirts...but alas...left it with a native friend (she also liked it alot) in Koh Samui Thailand.
pretty good food, fantastic atmosphere, slightly overpriced, but not unreasonable for the quality and atmosphere
went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel.
Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.
Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type, but the real stuff.  Mac-n-cheese, green beans cooked in animal fat, salmon cakes, fried chicken.  It's all good.  I love the mac-n-cheese and will often just order a veggie plate where I can pick 4 different ones to eat.  They always have vegetable specials so I can try something new every time I go.    They also had 4 different hot sauces on the table.  I made a point to sample them all on the delicious corn bread they make.
Stopped by last week.  Store was going to close for a couple of weeks for remodel and I think a cafe will be put in the front.    The pita bread is made fresh daily as are many of the other prepared foods.  You can watch the pita being made thru the window in the bakery.  The pita is wonderful and you can pick up so many delicious Mediterranean food items to take home.  Olive oil, olives, cheeses, Hoummus Dip, Baba Ghannouj, deserts, Halva, Specialty Pita Pies.    Good food and friendly service.
I was in the market for a black floral embossed belt (no giant buckle) I knew exactly what I wanted, but wanted to try it on first, and possibly support a local business rather than order one over the internet. Granted I do not look like the typical type of person who might frequent this establishment as; I'm white, I was wearing Lucky Jeans, a Locoste shirt, Chuck Taylors, and a Cardinals hat (I don't know how one would classify that look, I certainly didn't think criminal intent when I was dressing that morning).  I walked in, scanned through the assortment of belts by the door, and then at the belts behind the counter, they were all slightly more “attention grabbing” than I was looking for. I was asked if I needed help by the young lady at the register, I replied that I was good, I then walked out and got in my car to drive away. It was at this point that a large man rushed out the door behind me grimacing and angrily staring at my car as he wrote my license plate down. I put my car in reverse and asked him if I had done something wrong, he replied they had been robbed and I told him I had no criminal intent I was just looking for a belt. This didn't seem to placate the beast as he aggressively informed me he was forced to do this (like almost accusing me of being a potential robber and trying to intimidate me against the course of action).  I don't know if this is the policy for all their customers or just any gringo's foolish enough to think they would be welcomed in this establishment. However the encounter was quite unsettling and I really would recommend you avoid this store unless you want to be made to feel like a criminal for no reason. Also for the record, I'm a medical professional and I make $30 an hr, THE LAST THING on my mind was robbing or stealing. Silly belts and supporting the local economy yes; robbing and stealing no.
The man who was taking in my dry cleaning order was very short with me, rude, and then threw (literally) my clothes into a basket as I walked away. I asked if he could be more gentle with my clothes and he told me “They're fine”. I promptly asked for my clothes back and took them to Denny's on Mattis. Last time I use any Starcrest dry cleaning.
Racist mall management team same team that ran century 3 mall in to the ground stay away nothing good comes out this place
If you're on a budget this place is probably 4 star however it's not for me. It's very bland- not something I'd expect from a Mexican restaurant.
I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.  I went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here).
I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.  Our waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).  We had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel “bones” were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.  Having read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a “lunch” sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The “fire roasted corn” was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.  We didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.  Would I go back? No, I don't think so.
Went to the Belk Bowl here. I couldn't believe how nice the stadium is inside. When Atlanta builds a new stadium, they need to take note. I was impressed by the food selection & quality. The bathrooms stayed clean & the attendants were all very nice & smiling. Kudos to the designers & managers of this facility. We had a nice visit to Charlotte & a W in the BoA Stadium.
I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill.
For tax levys, late paperwork, and apologies after the fact, come to Sorge!  We had every penny in our accounts levied by the state because Sorge didn't do what they agreed to do in a timely manner.  In fact, they never did it at all, just “forgot about it!”  Wife is 8 months pregnant and ALL of our money (thousands) we saved for the baby coming is gone!
I guess there is no way to really make Amtrak improve by making a one-star review, but I think it's awful how expensive it now is to go to Chicago given the quality of the service. I live in Stockholm now and was entertaining notions of going back to Champaign to do another degree, but really...it's an isolated place if you don't have a car. It shouldn't be a big deal to go to Chicago. It shouldn't use up all my money or my patience. I've had 11 hour delays on Amtrak! Chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city. The fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the University.   Sweden benefits enormously from having fast, relatively cheap, and hassle-free railway. I don't have to sit on a cramped bus next to a McDonalds eating elementary school kid or endure six hour delays on a crappy train to get to places like Oslo and Copenhagen. I'm bragging now, but UIUC needs Amtrak to shape up.
Here's a sample experience at MacAlpines:  Wow! A real, old fashioned soda parlor! Whoa, look at all this vintage stuff! Hey, check out the menu! Oh hell yeah I love this kind of candy, I haven't seen this in forever! Oh maaan 99 flavors of soda what the whaaat!   Mmm.. pina colada soda, wait, the butter pecan is even better! No, taste the margarita! Wait, they're refillable! AHHH!!!! VANILLA COKE! BUBBLEGUM! MORE BUTTER PECAN! HEY THERE'S CHOCOLATE! GIVE ME AN IRISH CREAM FLAVOR! PUT CARAMEL IN IT! ANOTHER CARAMEL, THIS TIME WITH CHOCOLATE! WE HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED THE ICE CREAM, WE NEED THIS ONE WITH ICE CREAM IN IT. MORE ICE CREAM YUM THRIFTY ICE CREAM!!!!!!!  Holy shiznit, that soda.... 'twas nothing but awesome... I don't feel so good.  *passes out in the car*  Arrives home.  *passes out for fifteen hours*  Awakens with a hangover more vicious than the Thursday following Wine Wednesdays at ASU. Remembers MacAlpines fondly while taking 3 Ibuprofen. Goes back to sleep.
Being born and raised into an all Italian family, I'm pretty darn picky about my pastas and gravy (tomato sauce for the unknowing). My great grandmother's sauce was the first I remember, she never opened a can to make her sauces, always using tomatoes she canned herself in mason jars. She simmered her sauces until every seed melted away. My mother's sauce was a bit more thicker, using puree and paste as a base, later adding whole peeled tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. Her sauce cooks down to a velvety pasta sauce that should be jarred and sold on super market shelves.  Sorry on to my review of Olive Garden. seriously? Really? No! I will admit it's good in a fit of really, REALLY needing a pasta fix, or if you want to eat breadstick and salad. But the sauces are overly rich, and I don't mean the tomato sauces. I mean the sauces they put over the pasta with chicken, beef or fish. And, let me be real Italian here, pasta is NEVER the main meal in an Italian supper, Pasta is normally the first course and NEVER served with meat, including MEATBALLS. Thats as American as fortune cookies. after pasta, comes the protein, that includes meatballs, then finally salad.  Okay, I'm done being a snooty Italian who looks down upon Olive Garden, I got out all my frustrations on you, my readers. But seriously, if you want good Italian food, hit up a REALLY good neighborhood, family owned Italian restaurant. The service is better, it will be cheaper and it won't go to a big conglomerate who over charges on a plate of pasta, which is one of the cheapest food you can serve. Oh, two stars for a pretty good bowl of Pasta Fazoo (pasta and beans).
Ajo Als on 16th Street es no bueno, my girlfriend and her brother got food poisoning from here yesterday! that's just gross!
I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well, but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should, for the most, part leave it long...she's a schnauzer, he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought, although last time it literally only took an hour, but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min, so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigi's beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasn't until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great, but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochie's ever again.
Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no, my satisfaction was not questioned.  I'll stick with Laredos.
The service is awful and you will often receive things you didn't order.  The food is ok, but get it carry-out after a quick inspection to make sure they included everything you paid for.
AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!  Our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.  I ordered what the waiter claimed was their “signature” dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained.  :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had “re-heated” it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he “saw” the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.  We told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.  The following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as “Aquavina”.  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.  AVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!
I went here today because my car needed an oil change.. badly. I'd been putting it off because I just moved here in August (am I allowed to say “just” still?) and wasn't sure how to go about finding a reliable place. I chose Meineke from the five or so car places I had coupons for by looking at the reviews on yelp. For 19.95 (or a little over $22 including tax) with my coupon (basic oil change is usually 24.95) I had my oil/filter changed and the oil disposed of properly, fluids topped off, and a basic belts/tires overall inspection. The men there were so friendly and speedy! They didn't give me the runaround.. just my oil changed with a smile. I would recommend them to anybody and will be back!  Also, from drive up to drive away it took maybe.. 30 minutes even though there were several other cars in the garage (I went at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon).
This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait, two parties came in and were seated while I waited. After complining I was seated.  Ordered a salad and ribs. The salad was good, the ribs were as tough as leather. The baked potato had to be broken with fork and knife since it probably had been baking for hours.  The only good thing about the experience was the server which was very attentive and appologized profusely for the innedible food.
The day radio shows have gotten worse ever since Darrell Ankarlo left due to his car accident injuries. Bruce St. James is a moderate left leaning. The afternoon guys are both Atheists.  KTAR has turned liberal. I only listen to AM 550 now.
Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy, since I went at 10:30 am. I hope this isn't a new trend.
I don't much like the look of this place - I never would have ventured in were it not for the positive yelp reviews - but they serve some pretty good pizza.    I have eaten trillions of pizzas.  Maybe more, I lost count.  And I'm not a a purist or a dogmatic devotee to any particular variety of pizza.  I grew up in Chicago, where I was weaned on deep dish, pan, and thin crust pizzas.  I lived in NYC for years, and tasted some of the finest thin crust on the planet.  (for the record, my favorites are DiFara's in Brooklyn and Coalfire, a relatively young pizza joint in Chicago).  Brixx does a fine job of the thin crust.  We had a wild mushroom pie and their pear and gorgonzola variety for kicks.  Both were pretty tasty.    I'll go back for more whenever the opportunity arises.  But here's what they could do a little better:  Get that oven hotter, and change the flour blend so that there's a crispness to the bottom and edges of the crust.  There's an axiom for thin crust pizza that goes something like, “if that shit don't crack, that shit is whack.”  So, when the pizza is folded, the bottom of the crust should crack.  Ditto for the edge of the crust.  (Allowances can be made for pizzas that have been ordered with soggy ingredients that necessarily soak through the crust, like spinach, ricotta, etc.)  Brixx's pizza did not exhibit cracking anywhere.  It was cooked only to the point of being bread-like.  Still tasty enough, but not quite there.  I hate to sound snotty about this, but I think it really adds to the pizza when parts of the crust have been cooked almost to the point of burning.  That crunch and underlying chewiness is irresistible.  Also, the mushroom pizza was finished with a sprinkling of what appeared to be shaved romano and a tossing of arugula, but when that was added, the pizza had been allowed to cool to the point where the romano didn't melt at all, and the arugula didn't wilt.  The result was a bit like having a salad on top of a pizza.  Pizza aside, they offer local beers, at least one NC wine, and have eco-friendly waterless urinals in the men's room (I applaud the effort, though that probably won't be the highlight of the review).  Next time I go in, I'll see it they can crispify my pie.
Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous.   Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.  First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury.   My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The “bacon” was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)    I will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.
I've been to Monty's at least once for every meal. The omelettes are to die for, huge in quantity unique in ingredients- highly recommend the spinach and feta. The salads are the same thing, definitely large and delicious. Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. Amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfort/diner food experience.
Ok, so this was really incredibly depressing.  We had heard such wonderful things about this place, and even really enjoyed mother's day brunch here.  BUT, when we went here last night for our anniversary dinner, it was incredibly lackluster.  the brie brulee was ok.  my husband's filet was very underwhelming (though the risotto was delicious), my pork was good, and the four berry tart was yummy.  The problem was that we could have spent that money somewhere else on an even better meal.  Having moved recently from San Francisco, we try to stop ourselves from over criticizing, but we've found some real gems in Phoenix.  Coup des Tartes is not one of them. :(
It has been a good year or two since I have eaten here last and I'm not sure why. Today reinforced how much I like this place. To me, Qdoba falls into the Chipotle category although I feel the portions are definitely more generous than Chipotle. I like to get the Naked Chicken Burrito which is essentially a burrito with no tortilla. So, basically the Chipotle burrito bowl. It is just under $6 and enough for two meals. I'll instantly halve it when I get home to prevent me from overeating. It is very good. Their guacamole is very good, too. They also have a pick 2 combo for $6 and gives you smaller portions of your choice of the naked burrito, mexican soup, tacos, cheese quesadilla, etc. The other thing I like about this place is the rewards program and also how nice the employees always are. Like I said, it has been a long time since I have been back and I always comment on how friendly the employees are. Good sign.
If there were an option to give an extra star for a “special” experience, I would surely do so for Golden Razor. I must confess that I have a really thick beard and my stubble would surely light a match. Well but it did meet its match out here. The shave out here gives me a sense of hope against the injustice of my beard. Also I have been lucky to taste some home made lemoncello from the house of the master himself!
I've never eaten at Hardee's.  I've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.  Yesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.  Boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.  Friend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.  Friend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.  I notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.  I check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.  No.  I tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. “Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!” I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell.
After returning from my trip from a big city fashion district, my inner creative genius led me to Sas Fabric. Upon entering the location I felt a gush of endless and surreal inspiration.  Why the fuss over a fabric shop you might ask? The fuss is over Sas Fabric shop! Move over Joanns, Walmart or any other ratty fabric place because no one beats Sas! An array of funky, bright, subtle, soft, crisp, shiny, and neutral fabrics fill your eyesight welcoming you to explore! My imagination was running wild in here! I felt as if I was at a true NYC fabric supplier! Other fabric stores in Phoenix simply do not compare and carry FAR less unique fabrics. Joanne is also more catered to the grandma crowd rather than the modern D.I.Y. creative soul. I highly recommened Sas for all fabric related projects. I've become loyal to Sas for its quality and superior selection. The staff is also very quick and experienced so they get you on your way to fulfill your creative urges! Five stars :)
We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.    We had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.    If you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.
A pool table. Reminiscent of a bye gone era. Best cut I've had in years. Thanks Omar
I have a new found love for Indian food and when I found myself in Madison I had to check this place out. It was most excellently delicious! The staff was very nice and the price for 3 people including 4 drinks and an appetizer was about $75. If you ever find yourself on the East side of Madison, you should really check this place out.
I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a “lemon” of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh, but where the hell is the flavor?  I can go as far as saying that I don't believe that they even season the burger with salt and pepper.  If I closed my eyes, it is possible that I wouldn't even know that it was a hamburger.  That is embarrassing.  Maybe if you're used to eating 99 cent burgers, Sysco “meat,” or at chain restaurants, then you would find this to be “amazing.”  I've had some of the best burgers at many cities in the US and this is an embarrassment to Pittsburgh.  Go to BRGR if you want a tasty burger near Bloomfield.  On the other end of the spectrum were the sides. The sides were classics, but definitely above average, especially the home fries.  I would consider a 1 star rating if it weren't for them.  Additionally, the place is overly crowded and had a long wait during the weekend. The decor is old school and seems satisfied in it's current state.  Just like the food itself.  File this one under Legacy restaurant still living on it's past accolades.
Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen.   The pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.
It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior, antique tin ceilings, a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers,  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place, but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango, map room, d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food.
A special place for me...  A few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and went for our first anniversary in January and still had some left over so we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a “snug” which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.  The food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.  Their happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to “by the glass” offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.  Another little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.  I've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!
Wow... The best Mexican restaurant in the country.    My advise to you making a connection in Charlotte airport.   Take the lastest contraction, take a cab here for lunch or dinner than go back to the airport.  It's worth the layover.    It's 5 minutes from the airport.
Enjoyed it through and through. Had the big unit hot dog. It was actually delicious. Will go back whenever im in Arizona. Oh! and the waitress was very nice.
Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).  We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!  Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.    Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag!   I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!
Really nice outdoor patio. Sunday drink special on whiskey was really good. Very reasonable price for uptown. Nice variations on Irish cuisine.  Worth checking out!
I had a tremendously positive experience at this Westin (the 12th-ish or so I've stayed at this year).    - Beautiful, very new-seeming property - Great location pretty close to anything you'll need - Reasonable prices on self-parking - Excellent service - Extremely clean, well-kept and comfy space (I was on the 22nd floor...so I suppose I can only speak for it) - Upgraded to a corner suite that was amazing---very well appointed, functional and comfortable  Again, this is my 12th or so Westin stay this year---and it has been the best of all of those.
Stumbled on this place while sight seeing on a long lay over in Phoenix. The food was moderately priced and service was quick. The waiter was pleasant. For being downtown the place was very quiet. In fact, the whole of downtown was quiet.
Alice Cooperstown is, as my husband said, “like a Hard Rock that's not stupid.”  The concept is a bizarre combo of Alice Cooper and a sports bar - and it works.    We stopped by two other places to check out their menus before a game, and they didn't look very thrilling.  The menu at Cooperstown is pretty extensive - lots of options.    The service was very quick and efficient.  I see no reason to go anywhere else before a D-Backs game.
DIRTY CAR EVEN AFTER MOST EXPENSIVE CARWASH.   This has happened to me three times there now. Each time, I get a car wash/oil change with the most expensive wash. Each time they leave my cup-holders, parts of windshield, and inside of doors/dash DIRTY... even though I reminded them that I would like them cleaned. This last time, it really looked like they just vacuumed my car. Also, they are really too expensive for what you get. They also get mad/rude if you don't upgrade to all the things they offer you. The sales guy at the beginning got grouchy with me and literally stopped talking to me as soon as I said, “No thank you” to a filter change.
I am not sure about the other services. But there is a hidden gem here. Lucy is an aesthetician. I strictly go to her for all of my brow waxing. My brows are a challenge and most have royally screwed them up. My brows should be the test for beauty schools. Lucy is seriously the brow whisperer. Go to her for your wax needs-- she is in a class all her own. This is the only reason why I give them 5 stars. Also the front desk service is always attentive and super nice.
Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good German cuisine in the QC.  Turns out you have to go to Pineville.  Also turns out it's well worth the drive.  The Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  Their tap selection is well-chosen and good.  The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic.  The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet caraway-seed version.  The wurst is the best in Charlotte.  (Please don't kill me.)  We started with the wurst plate, served with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good German food in a while, and was in a celebratory mood.  I had the jagerschnitzel.  It was made entirely of food.  Pork was thin, crispy and delicious.  Red cabbage was firm and sweet.  Sp\u00e4tzle needed salt, but it usually does.  Heated up well the next day, also--there was a lot of it.  She had the venison.  Sweet lord.  That is all.  An older gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting.  I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.  It is a little pricier than I would've liked, but I don't think that is going to stop me from going back.  Regularly.
We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be “chilly capsicum” instead of “chilly chicken”.  Worst dish!!!   Don't ever order chilly chicken here.
Unlimited hot coffee. I don't have any recollection of what I ate....  I wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal I cannot recall.  I know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in Deforest.  For that, I give it four stars.
Mert's has my favorite collard greens and corn bread in Charlotte.  The salmon cakes are delicious as are the pork chops.  Fried chicken is above average, although not as delicious as the previous two entrees mentioned.
Says they deliver on here... Wrong & wrong again & should not be checked! I like Applebee's & thought the delivery was something new for the Pittsburgh area... Don't know if this is something Yelp does or something someone checked off... But not cool!
The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
Very scary and shady vibe. As a woman, I will never come back here. A lot of standing around and staring at customers.  I felt extremely uncomfortable.
I've never been to New Orleans, so I don't know if that makes me somehow less qualified to review this place.  But, I suspect a fair amount of people have never been to China, and it doesn't stop them from reviewing PF Changs.  ANYWAY, the thing about NOTO whenever I have eaten there is that I am always expecting it to be way greater than it really is because of the way people talk about it.  I am always expecting this transcendent experience, but really, all I get is a styrofoam container of some spicy slop that really has no real flavor underneath the initial tongue shock of cayenne pepper.
So let's get this out of the way up front: The food here's pretty good. There I said it. I always enjoy the food, there's not been one thing there that I've eaten that I didn't like. That being said, food isn't going to make me return to a place to eat. We usually get takeout from CB because their service flat out sucks. My wife made me go with her this past weekend, because I've been making her get takeout form Hula Modern Tiki the past few times (Hula's great). So against my will, and because it was on the eve of Valentine's day, I decided to cave against my better judgement. I should be totally ticked, but because they didn't fail my expectations and screwed up my meal/deliviered craptacular service, wifey won't be making me go again. Win, I think.  I always make it a point to order the dinner special from places with the idea that the chefs are sick and tired of cooking the same stuff on the menu, and will be invigorated at cooking something new and exciting. This particular night, I opted for the Miso Marinated Sea Bass. Sounds great, right? I'll never know.....the server never brought it to me. Appetizer arrived, wife's meal arrived, daughter's bowl of steamed rice arrived, beer arrived, sake arrived, check arrived. Not in that order, but you get my drift. So my meal consisted of some of my wife's sushi, some of my daughter's steamed rice, some of the appetizer, beer, sake and table bread. Happy Valentines to you Cherry Blossom!  If anybody's thinking of checking this place out, get takeout. The food's good, but I can get better service at QT. (Yes, the gas station)
Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all. I just called and explained to the person at the front desk that I have been having some breast pain and didn't know if I should come in earlier than my Oct. 1st  Well Woman exam. Her response was, “Well, if you come in early you will have to pay for an office visit.” I said, “well if I wait I'll just talk to her about it at my Well Woman.” Her reply, “if you talk to her about it then, then you will be charged extra.” My reply, “just for talking about it??” Her reply, “yup, I don't know what to tell you. Just go to your primary care physician.” I then explained to her that this was a gynecological issue... No response. Her overall tone was brash, rude, and short. Did I mention uncaring.  Unbelievable. Never, ever have I been so appalled. A woman calls and says she has breast pain and isn't sure if she should come in and this is how the front desk responds!! I'm outraged and waiting for someone to call me back from the office. I think Dr. Johnstone has the right to know how the front desk is treating her patients.
My girlfriend REALLY hyped this place up but I ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal I couldn't even eat. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (Waitress's favorite) and it was disgusting. The sauce was VERY over powering and it was drenched in it. If that wasn't bad enough the Chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. I ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. Won't be going back here...
Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.  Here's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.  Here's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)  For us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.  So after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me.
Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.    We got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.  I guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere.
The margaritas wont do ya dirty!
This place is ok. The people who work there are amazing though. They love what they do and they enjoy helping you. They have a great comic book selection however, I wish they carried more toys.   Sadly, this placed is owned by a guy who only cares about profit and not customer service. Kind of a jerk.
Loved this place.  Wasn't sure what to expect.  My cousin told me that they had the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Well, Ria, you were right!   Done to perfection, exactly the way I asked for it.  Not only was the burger great, the potato salad with came with it was just wonderful.  I think  Tessaro's will be on our list of go to places from now on!
So honest moment I was actually here for another event but what a treat it was to have it hosted such a great venue.   While we waited for our event to start we were able to walk around and read a little history on the planes and models that were there. By far the best attraction was the plane that was in route to Charlotte and landed on the Hudson. After seeing the damages and reading the stories this was nothing short of a miracle.   Another really cool feature is that they have preserved personal items from the passengers and flight crew which is a really nice touch. If you're into history, aviation or just want to know more about this memorable flight...you'll want to visit here!
Mimosa is fantastic. I went there for lunch recently for my friend's birthday. I had the best cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. It was topped with bacon and cheddar cheese, but the burger itself was just seasoned perfectly. Mm mm. It is on the pricey side, but it's definitely more reasonably priced for lunch, so I'd recommend checking it out then. As other Yelpers have said, it's just one of those restaurants where everything you order is likely to be good.
Another chain sit down by the mall,  but not at the top of my list. The food hasn't seemed to change since I've gone here except for less options.  Waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times. Recently got a burger there. Asked for well done,  and burger arrived bloody and red.  Waiter took it back and about 5 minutes brought the same burger back and was still pink on the inside.  Was offered something else,  but the others I was with were already done.  Did get a coupon for a return visit. Good deal with the 2 for $20 and an app if your food is cooked right.
Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you're driving, parking is conveniently located across the street, though the parking garage should come with a set of directions on exactly where to pay when you leave the building (or maybe I'm just more obtuse than the average parker).    The hotel restaurant has pretty good food and the bar is a great place to hang out and have some snacks (the house-made chips are addictive) and enjoy a nice drink.  And if you have the great pleasure of having Sam as your bartender, you're definitely guaranteed good conversation and a few laughs.  Just make sure you bring up Justin Bieber--she really loves that little fella....
Best place in Charlotte for comics, hands down. Sadly, not the best place to go for a friendly staff. Condescending tones and mockery of things I asked for/was inquiring about are not a good way to get return business! :( I'll buy online before I go in here again.
I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest, had the personal recommendations from friends not made this place seem like the biggest deal in the city, then I would have probably rated it a 3 or 4. The pizza was just OK. It was decently greasy and the crust wasn't all that special. They wouldn't deliver (Even though I am literally a few blocks from them) and they don't accept credit / debit card - a huge downfall for me.
WORST NIGHTS SLEEP I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not only was the mattress ridiculous stiff to where I ended up laying on the bed pillows and only got a couple hours of sleep.  When I went down to the front desk at 6am to request a room change due to the mattress (and I should really say I hobbled down due to being stiff & sore) the front desk lady was unsympathetic and said that all the mattress's in the hotel are the same.  She gave me no options and asked if I wanted to check out and of course offered no refund or discount.  Even going back up to my room to pack I encountered other guests who were complaining about the stiffness in their back from the mattress.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!  The breakfast, location, pool, and fitness room nowhere near out way the amount of pain you will be in all day because of one nights stay.  I wish I could give them a zero on Yelp but alas I am forced to give them 1 star which they are undeserving of.
Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl, but the Steelers still rock with six rings, Baby!!! Just stating what all Steeler fans know: a Steel Dynasty is still unmatched no matter what team claims the title of current Super Bowl Champs.. Go Steelers!!!
I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with,   I brought my car for a few touch ups, my trunk the back shield,  and the grill for bugs, and dash/cup holder area.  My car was parked for 10 min before I asked when they would notify me it's was complete.  They had a system error, and refused to honor my groupon. I was advised to contact corporate.  After 20 min on hold the girl who answered indicated someone would call me back.    I asked about my car,  the agent went outside and then came back and indicated it was done.   The bugs were still all over the grill,  cup holders and dash hadn't been touched,  car was clearly not vacuumed,  neither was the trunk. The service agent immediately went to wiping off the bugs, as I became more and more upset about the poorly rendered car wash.  I went inside and asked for a refund.  A gentleman told me I was just upset because of the groupon. I continued to advise it was the half hearted car wash that had me upset.  To which he continued to rebuttal that I was just upset about the Groupon.   Another associate took me to the car to find our what was wrong.  I pointed out the various items and he indicated he would fix the situation.  I ended up waiting near the detailing crew, who didn't hide the use of profanity. They we're shouting insults to one another. Not the most professional display,  even for a car wash.   Eventually I got my car,  still not vacuumed thoroughly and left.  Safe to say after coming sporadically (as needed) fire 7 years,  I'm fine not coming back to Dannys with the hit and miss service and bad car washes
My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.  Parking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).  The coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).  One perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.  The bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.  All in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.
I write this review strictly as a seller, as I never come here solely to buy, always to sell and sometimes to trade. If you trade in items, you will get 35% of the retail price in cash or 50% in trade credit, period. The young ladies who run the shop are razor sharp and know the tastes of their shoppers. The store has an interesting selection of accessories and clothing, the quality of which runs the gamut from cute cheap Chinese crap to OMG is this really $15 superior quality items. Look and look often because inventory turns over and fast. If you want a quick hit of something unique or need to offload some extra items, make a beeline for this place. It's environmentally responsible and they have a donation program for local nonprofit agencies. This is NOT a thrift store, so leave that notion at home. It's a secondhand shop that thinks like a consignment store. You pay a little more than a thrift store but you have a much greater chance of finding something fantastic in pristine condition.
I want to review the salon there, particularly Kristina.  When I walked in, I told her that she could do whatever she wanted to with my hair, and just gave her a few basic guidelines.  My cut turned out amazing!  I now have this punky choppy awesome cut, which I love and get compliments on all the time!  She is not the super chatty or gossipy type, which is fine with me - though I know some want that from their stylist.  Also, she is not as good with color as she is with cutting, but with suggestions from the other stylists my color turned out great as well.
No matter how often I'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. If I ever find another place to take children's items, I will not return. There is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone.
This week, I took my son to see the “Chipmunks Squeakquel” (or whatever it's called). We've been here several times before, since it is in the University City area near where we live.   There is plenty of parking. Lines for tickets are usually long, and uncomfortable in the cold, blowing wind of December, or the humid summer heat, for that matter. (Why can't they put the ticket counters on the INSIDES of theaters? This is one tradition that should be broken soon!)  Matinee tickets for the two of us were $13.50.   The theater itself is in good shape. Movies are usually in focus, and the sound is usually okay, with some distortion, but not great. (Frankly, DVDs sound better in my living room.)  BUT: Concessions are a complete rip-off. I usually know this, but Jay talked me into it. We got a medium (huge!) popcorn, two “small” bladder-busting drinks, and a box of Twizzlers. Twenty friggin' bucks! I'm sure the DVD wouldn't cost $33.50 to buy, and we could watch it over and over. (I doubt we'll be buying it... the movie is grade B entertainment. Funny once, but pretty stupid to watch as a rerun.)  The restroom had no paper towels, and the trash cans were overflowing. A smell of stale vomit permeated the area by the sinks.   For a family, I think money spent on a large LCD TV and a home theater in a box sound system is a wise investment. Rent movies from Red Box or Netflix, or hook up an Apple TV or something similar, and you have a better “movie-NOT-going” experience.   I can make much better (and less expensive!) popcorn, and the adults and I can have a beer. AND, I can pause the movie for those all-important, “Let's all go to the lobby” breaks.  Every time I go to the theater to see a flick on the big screen, I'm more and more disappointed by the experience. I guess a lot of others feel the same way, since the theater we were in was nearly empty.  It's a pity; you would think they would set the prices low enough to ensure all the seats are filled at most screenings. If they used some basic Economics 101 theory in their marketing model, and made a little on each of a lot of people, the total revenue would be maximized, and everyone would win. But as it is, they're losing more and more of us to the home theater market for 90+% of our movie-viewing dollars.
This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great, the heart was perfect, and he loved it!
Great bagels, sandwiches, soup, and coffee! My favorites are the veg-out bagel sandwich, the bagel dog on onion, and their sour cream potato salad is so good too. If you like all beef hotdogs, you should try the bagel dog. They wrap bagel around the dog. When they heat it up, the juice soaks into that chewy bagel and it is heaven.  Mmm.
My husband and I are new to Phoenix and have decided to try as many local places as possible. Intrigued by the outside decor, we ventured into this odd place. We ordered 2 meals and sat at a greasy, dirty table.  Our wings and burger arrived and we were thoroughly disappointed. The wings (some spicy ranch and some garlic Parmesan) were soggy from the grease and extra chewy. The burger appeared to have been  put in the fryer with the wings. The bun was soggy and the patty doused in pepper.  They did try to make their greasy food healthier by handing out sandwich bags with carrots and ranch. Good effort.  The one star it gets is for decor and fries. The fries are great, just covered in salt (shake then it off and they will be fine.) The decor will keep you entertained and avoid awkward silences.
Like most other Westins, the decor is very nice, and rooms are spacious and full of amenities. The bar and the restaurant is pretty good. Location is in  downtown, but certainly on the edge of town.  Deducting one star since they don't have a platinum/concierge lounge.
Manager (Owner?) is very chill... Some people might not be used to it. It's a southern thing though! Lol... Anyways! The food is good, I always get either the pulled pork sandwich or the hot link sandwich. The BBQ is the ish!!!!!! I love it, can't get enough. I was reading some other reviews & all I can say is Love it or hate it, I happen to love it. PS: it's really not as bad as people make it seem... Give it a try.
Internet Connection  = $60  Wi-Fi router = $120  Daily internet pass = $4.95  Losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.  $4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.  If you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else.
Prime time location, and they know it.  Yet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it.  The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a “lobster roll” so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic. Service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.  Go to Wholey!!!!
Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.    The “presses” are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.  Even Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!
Cute place... I went here after a kickball game with some of my team members.  The staff were fantastic.  I called to make a reservation and they were very nice.  They also called back to make sure it was ok for us to sit in the bar.    Upon arrival the bartender was very pleasant.  She showed me to the table which was marked reserved.    She took drink orders then food orders.  My guests said the food was good but I didn't have anything.  There are TVs all around the bar and some games to play as well.  This is a little gem in the South Hills!
Everything about this place screams a budget hotel, except for the price.   This is a motel quality establishment charging upscale hotel quality prices.    Granted, the staff is nice.  And, if you need a place that allows pets, I guess this could be a good choice.   Otherwise, don't be fooled.   I have staid at other homewood suites in the past, and this one is certainly not up to par.
Massive sewer roach issue and I will scream it from the mountain tops until it is addressed. I fucking hate living here...They act like they're all over it but they're not.  The staff fucks each other and the units are poorly maintained. They put a dog area right outside my apartment and people just bring their dogs to shit and piss...  The gate is constantly broken and there is no security here. When I'm in the pool at night I hear gunshots! When I asked about the shady online reviews at EVERY reputable online renters community/open forum my rental agent told me not to worry about it lmao!!!  RENTER BEWARE!!!!! Please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here.   I can't WAIT until this lease is up.
If you were to base 7 Cees as a restaurant it definitely will get one star.   However this place is known as a grease spoon dive.  That is exactly what it is and by far the very best dive diner that I have ever been too.           Jeanie is great.  She will be your greeter, your hostess, your waitresses, your personal cook, your bus person, and your cashier.  whew!!!!  Jeanie is not a jeannie in a bottle. She cannot snap her fingers so that your meal magically will appear in front of you.  She is the only person that I have ever seen working in there and you will definitely need time to wait and wait for your food.   Her cooking area is quite small.  Trust me you do not want to question her about where your meal is or how much longer it will take for you to get it.   Jeanie does swear like a sailor, but in a quiet mild manner and NOT like a raging lunatic.  When you come here you will have to except every swear word constantly flowing from her mouth.    Trust me I  hate it with a passion when people swear, but with Jeanie, it is okay.   But with Jeanie, you have to know it is coming and it will be coming in full force.  However while Jeanie will swear like a sailor she greets everybody with a kind and sweet heart.  She will make your order the way you want it.  Beware!!!!!  The portions are huge!!!!!   The coffee is endless. The prices are very reasonable.    So why only four stars when it should really be a five.  Well as I mention Jeanie's swearing like a sailor is part of the 7 Cees experience.  I can deal with hearing damn, mf, shit,  etc.  I cannot stand hearing my best friends name being used in vain or as curse words.  When people say Jesus Christ name or God followed by the d word.... I get upset.
Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches.  It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great side treats.  And the meat-a-tarians in the family loved their sandwiches too!
At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.    Entrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.    It's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt.   Judging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.
Maybe it was the time of day (afternoon) but something was very off today. The cheese plate arrived long after the entrees, my companion's bacon wrapped scallops seemed uncooked and raw.   The chicken schnitzel was fine.   Good beer and wine selection.  Slow service.
This might be a good way to kill time if you're near the airport, the food really wasn't that great. It tasted cheap and like it had been sitting there for a very long time. I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldn't really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I could've gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else.
Great place, good food
This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff
Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order.
Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.
Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic server will remind you of this no matter how frequently you visit.  You could get the best damned French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty sure he'd still point out the special.  Did you read what I wrote there?  Best. Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.  How is it so good?  That's a good question.  Somehow the combination of totally ordinary white bread and totally ordinary pancake batter transcends the potential of both parts to result in something truly drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  If you like French toast, there's no reason to consider anything else on the menu.  BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly over-medium eggs, and delicious pancakes.  The coffee is, well, blackish, but it's really not fair to judge a diner on the quality of their coffee.  Your mug will always be full, for better or for worse.  My husband and I moved away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  But there's only one Sam's, and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.
I like the food and donuts, but and more importantly, I really like the people who run this place and the people who hang out there.
Wow..never thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference.  This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar!   Called about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said “no we are not hiring” and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added “if you are in the business,  you should know not to call during lunch!”   Its 1:30, past lunch time “rush” and this bitch had to open her probably fat, pimple faced mouth and give this rude comment?! This was so uncalled for!!  So I went in this shitty place to complain (so glad I did not applied at this nasty ass place-which I did not understand why anybody else did not smell or see how nasty this place really is!) and asked for the manager. This  nasty toothless so called”waitress” said he was bartending and was busy! I still spoke to this (piece of shit Is way too much nice of a word for this asshole!)manager and was treated again like a piece shit and he bitched me out saying “if you are not a customer, I don't have time for your shit and come back later!!”   Well the only time I would come back to this shitty bar if I ever wanted a staff infection or hepatitis from the gross bathrooms!   How can anybody eat at a place where the management treats anyone this way??!!  I would never eat here and wouldn't anyone else eat at this place!!
Classic, just like you remember.,,,,  Perhaps, like me, you remember trips to the A&W as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous, frosty mug of sweet, cold root beer as a special treat.  I remember agonzing over the decision, ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer (parents wouldn't let us have both).   I hadn't stopped into an A&W in a long, long, time and was looking for something a little less fast-foody on my drive south when I decided to stop at this A&W.  I've driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from Minneapolis to Madison but had never before stopped in.  I got a burger and fries, which were fine, but the real treat was a real frosty mug (eat in only) that I could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel A&W root beer.  Now that was a really something special.
I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket, helmet and gloves. Their store is pretty nice inside, and they have a good selection of gear (mostly dirt-oriented though).   I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I asked a lady for some assistance in picking out a helmet. She was helpful, and recommended a jacket that would be usable in different types of weather. However, a friend who was with me said he had a different type of jacket (which they also sold), and she commented that the “hated” that jacket and that the liner was “nothing more than a glorified garbage bag.” Ok...  We also talked to a guy at the register about a '96 KTM 300 MXC that my friend just bought, and asked a simple question about a clutch cable. The guy seemed totally disinterested and clueless, and I'm not really sure if he even knew what a clutch was. He ended the conversation by saying that my friend should just throw his bike away because it was so old. What!?  Even after that, I still bought a jacket from them and ordered a helmet I liked that they had assured me would be in later that week. I then got a call from them a few days later saying that the helmet was no longer available, but that I could pick another style. I then just ordered the helmet online and went back the next day to get a refund.  I wanted to like this place, but between the thinly-veiled insults and seemingly clueless repair staff, I don't think I'll ever return. Their prices and selection are pretty decent, so if you are in the area and know what you want, it might be OK to stop by and pick something up. If you have any alternative, though, I would avoid this place.
I went to see In the Wake of Bounty (part of Fringe Fest 2011) and besides the show being exquisite, the venue was perfect.  Phoenix Little Theatre is basically attached to the Phoenix Art Museum which means you can stroll about in the little park area before the show. Take goofy pictures with the headless children statues and throw wishing pennies into the fountain overlooked by the uber masculine yet pensive sculpture.     Free and plentiful parking!!!  The theatre is really intimate with a small stage and limited seating. With that being said... any seat would give a great view of the happenings on stage.  Only downside is that the theatre chairs and my rear end did not get along amiably.  Lots of fidgeting on my part and constant readjusting.
Cheap! doesn't necessarily mean bad - at least not here at the Stan's Market. However, you will definitely have to check, double check and triple check on some occasions before you buy anything.  We stop here twice a month to do our groceries - mostly for less likely perishable produce like the garlic, ginger, peppers, baby cucumbers. However, we usually end up buying a lot more than that since we cook on a daily basis. If you happen to buy some of the soft fruits like the strawberries, blue berries or the grapes - you will most likely need to finish it up with in a day or two. If not, you can always freeze them to make smoothies.  Let me say this again, this place is cheap. The prices I pay for the produce here are usually 1/3 of the price I pay at Giant Eagle. So, if you know your produce - this is definitely the place to stop.
The staff are great. Actually the room is well noisy, but the kindness of all staff compensates for any other problem. I received several boxes in the hotel, I was not charged for receiving them at any time and any member of the staff made no comment about it. I really enjoyed all the hotel service and location (except for the noise) is great - very easy access. Recommend without any disorder.
Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for.   I don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop.   For those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason.   Beware, they only accept cash. But there is an ATM on site!
Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium, which it certainly was NOT. When I FINALLY got a chance to ask about it, she acted indignant that I would question her then checked her pad, yes, I ordered medium. Then she stared at me. Stared.   I have to say, I have never felt smaller in any restaurant experience in my life. Extremely disappointing and appalling. Will give our business to Capital Grille from now on. I urge you to do the same.
Have been dying to try this kosher place for some time. Went tonight and ordered a large 3 cheese pizza.  O M G american cheese??? I asked also for baked ziti and the lady said her ziti can't keep for a week so they don't make it. Are you kidding me? It was 19.00 with a drink. I put the pizza in the trunk and went to La Bella
Heading to catch a flick at The Arizona Center. Decided to checked out Mi Amigo's. To start with, it took about 5 minutes before anyone bother to talk to us. Once we did get to order, we opted to share the tortilla soup and the chicken fajitas. The tortilla soup was really bad. It tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt. We ended up sending it back. The chicken fajitas were actually ok, but not great.   The real downer was the service. Waitstaff appeared to be fairly apathetic about the place. Limited interested in actually taking our order, bringing out food, etc..  Overall, there are much better choices. You should look elsewhere if you are hungry for Mexican food.
Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient, still had a red welt 3 days later. She also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary. Eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $18. Do not go here for waxing!
I used to think it was a One-star. At first, I loved the outdoor seating (still do), the decent beers and the average but very cheap food... I HATED that as a gay couple we felt really weird with all the drunk 30-40 somethings disapproving and some strange looks from staff... however things seem to have changed in that regard and we haven't had any adverse experiences in the last 6 months. Yeay.
I am reviewing specifically the Chicago Hot Dog Cart in this Home Depot. I Love it!  Who in their right mind does not want to go to a store on a Saturday afternoon shop and then have one of the best Hot Dog's in Madison?   I'm just saying for $3.00 I can have a Chicago style hot dog loaded with all the fixins' including a kosher pickle. It's great.  My wife gets the chili dog and swears by it. She also has said on multiple occasions at the Home Depot that the chili dog is one of the best in the area.   Who would guess that a small little hot dog stand sitting in the Home Depot was so awesome!   I'm telling you, instead of running out to your car to drive back home and think about doing your weekend warrior projects, take a minute and snag a hot dog at the cart located inside the entrance of Home Depot.  Vienna Dogs, true Chicago dog style! Great hot dog!
Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!
Liz is amazing! Such a wonderful person and business owner! The way she treats her clients is unheard of now a days. I highly recommended that if anyone is looking for a great groomer, puff and fluff will treat your beloved pet like royalty.
Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green, neon lights, mirrors, and wall murals. I loved it!  Went in for dinner a little late, still being on west coast/vacation time, but there were still quite a few people and we weren't rushed at all. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu, even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs.   We started with two margaritas and the Espinaca con queso. Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce. OH how I love this white, creamy, spicy sauce!! Maybe a spicy sour cream? It was delicious! Hubby got steak fajitas which were good, but believe it or not, I was hooked on the grilled onions! They were so flavorful! I'm glad there were a lot on his platter so I could steal more than a few.
Food: very good, seasonal menu with at least 3 vegetarian friendly entrees when I was there (soups weren't veg-friendly), all three entrees we ordered, particularly the gnocchi, were excellent, house dressing is good too  Drinks: full liquor selection and good beer choices too  Atmosphere: we sat outside, and the patio is great, unique arrangement, feels very European  Service: prompt, friendly, overall very good  (+): connected to Creamery upstairs, so if they run out of a specific desert, always great options to bring back to your table  (-): could have used more bread, both in the basket and refilled more often
I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte, so I went and invited some of my friends and decided to come here to check it out. Here are my reviews.  Venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in Japan. If you have a large group of people, your group will be sitting as if you're sitting on a floor, but your not. The sits are elevated and the center piece is wide open. It's a comfortable sitting arrangement.  Sushi - the Unagi (Eel) was cooked perfectly. The softcrab shells are not bad, but I had better ones before.  The rice was cooked very well not to sticky or clumpy. They need better selections in sushi.  Presentation - the restaurant lacks in presentation.  It was a very simple dish put together.    Sake - they are pricey. $15.00 minimum.   Ramen - the soup was very tasty.    Overall,  if you are craving for ramen, this is the best place so far I've tasted. As for sushi, I would only come here once. I've had much better sushi with awesome presentation and much better selections in California before.  I still have yet to find a sushi that will replace my experienced in California. Also, if you don't tip enough. You will be called back in by the waitress asking you to add more on the tip. Its a MANDATORY!!!  It feels like a teacher is about to scold you.
My instinct always told me that I should skip this place. Should have listened. It was just gross; literally and figuratively. I was afraid to see what I was stepping on out on the dance floor. Music was good, drinks were surprisingly decent. But oh, the other club patrons... I appreciate a little adult fun time dancing as much as the next gal, but it was just sleazy.
Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed!   I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!!   For my first course i had the “Baked Beans” as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....  Only good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!
I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken, what a disappointment. None of these tasted good, Tom Yum soup was kinda disgusting.
Great place! Good pizza that tastes great and is very authentic! We had a mushroom and sausage and we were very impressed. You won't be disappointed!
Excellent food, nice beverages, more than fair prices, & great service. Waitress remembered us & was a doll. Owner Elias is a delightful gent & such a really welcoming character. We'll be back. Very pleased.
Ok, this place has decent food.  Well, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.  However, for a small mom and pop place, they don't seem to do much to make people feel welcome.    The last time I ate there was the last time.  I had breakfast with a friend of mine, and all was going well, weak coffee aside.  We ordered some breakfast, and the waitress (who turned out to be one of the managers or supervisors) asked if we wanted gravy on our potatoes.  My friend said “I'd love it on the side, please” only to be told “No.”  When he said “no?” she replied “Gravy is complimentary, and you either have it on the potatoes or no gravy.”  I made the choice then that if one bowl for gravy was too precious to wash, then I would save them the time and effort by not going back.  Problem solved, all dishes are clean!  Skip it and go to Sam's cafe.
I don't know what happen to Hooters? My roommate in college use to work for one in Houston so I have frequent Hooters a time or hundred in my life. The quality of the product has no integrity it is so nasty, the wings are never fried correctly they come out bloody and under sauced. I just want some wings once in a while with breading.  iIt is difficult to find.
Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.
Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome.
I've shopped here before. Overpriced livestock & fish supplies. Customer service was not that great. Petco has better pricing on supplies and good selection of reasonably priced freshwater, live rock & saltwater livestock.
If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.    Got the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.    Summary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again.
Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season for dinner or drinks.  You will thank me.     Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right now, decorated with lovely garlands and greenery and twinkling lights (I love twinkly things).  It truly looks out of a movie.  And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly.  A little bit magical.    I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not been in awhile.  We went  last night to meet friends for drinks and dinner before heading to one of my all-time favorite venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  Great beer selection.  We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not so much), my hubs said the burger was good, fried pickles (yum!), veggie pita was great, but you have to get the “what it is.”  What it is sustained me for years.  I'm veggie now, so no chicken for me... but, it was good all those nights!  While the food is not 5-star worthy, the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.
Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.    My order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.    Additionally (and this may seem like a strange note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand.   My office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service.
Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as “Martini specialists” but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair. A much better martini can be had at “Urban Sip” above the Ritz - they have Spanish giant olives hand-stuffed with blue cheese.
Coming from California, these are the cheapest drinks I've ever encountered! We called ahead of time to ask them to play the niners game, even though the bears / packers were the favored game of the day (and time). They had a TV set up all ready with the niners game when I got there.  There are peanut shells all over the ground, which I find a little tacky and dangerous. The Pizza was pretty decent - thin crust. We ordered the Hawaiian although we substituted BBQ sauce for regular pizza tomato sauce.  There are fun pool tables and other arcade games. A jukebox for your favorite tunes can be found near the bar, i think.  This place seems to be a staple of downtown champaign.
Not impressed!!  If there were 0 stars that's the rating this place would get.  I ordered a cheeseburger and it was worse than what you'd expect from a school lunchroom!   And why is this place called an “Irish Pub”?  One would expect typical Irish dishes but not here!  I honestly have no idea how this place stays in business.  Sorry, Hartigan's, I won't be going back!
I'd give it a zero if I could. This place is weak as fuck. Mexican food? Please. I'd rather go to Taco Bell. There's a taco truck down the road that you're better off spending your money on.
Great place tucked away in 4th ward. You'd never know it was there. Only caveat is that parking is near-impossible. Strict street parking rules make it tough to come here if you're driving.   London broil Sandwhich was clutch. Good ambiance as well.   Hope to return soon.
From the outside you see a quiet street with some couples strolling along hand-in-hand.  As you get closer to the front door you hear a bit of a buzz.  Is that a bar?  What's going on in there?  Once the door is open you are hit with a wave of laughter, glasses clinking, and the sound of people talking.  I think this is going to work out just fine.  The Great: + The bartender/host/server/manager/busboy.  This guy was friendly, funny, and helpful.  Quick to smile and full of insight, he is awesome. +  A great selection of local beers. +  Cool location and extremely cozy inside.  The Average: o  The only food we ordered was a crab soup - which was completely average.  With that said, this place would be my local watering hole if I lived in the 4th Ward.  Well done!
I can't believe I waited 11 years to go here. I love nature. I love being outside.  I'm in love. In fact, my first visit 2 months ago inspired my mom to get us both memberships.  I loved the tour of the main loop. We learned a lot about some of the plants. I've worked in landscaping and know a lot about desert plants, but we learned a lot of cultural stuff, too.  I went back for the Chihuly exhibit. It's the coolest thing I have ever seen, and some of the sculptures were so beautiful I cried a little.  The staff is a lot of volunteers, so you know they enjoy being there. In fact, I am going to talk to them about volunteering as soon as the holidays are over. I can't wait to go again!
WOW! Very good food!!!!! The wait staff was very friendly and quick!  I always love the sharing family style of chinese restaurants!  You must go here!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!  And the person who suggested the donuts!!! THANK YOU!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!!!
Granted it's a dive campus bar but been frequenting them for half price burgers on Tuesday. Food was pretty good, loved the Mac and cheese as an upgrade. However today's visit had a special friend attend with us. Spotted a cockroach crawling on the wall. So much for the green health inspection sign on the door! Needless to say we won't be back anytime soon.
A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.
The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.
Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea, five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!  From there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped, still good!  I'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress, I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!  Persian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio, Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!  Baklava a bit disappointing, papery filo, though drier than the overly syrupy version
The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone.
HOHO CHERRY HOUSE, not to be confused with a brothel, offers average food at cheap prices. Fast delivery and friendly staff. No matter what protein you pick it pretty much tastes the same.
The last 3 or so times I've visited, they've been closed 15 minutes early.  On the plus side, I've discovered I look damn good with longer hair.
This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill.   This is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre, nothing really memorable.  The 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago, name change but the bad service stayed.  Went with a group of about 8 - 10 people on a Thursday night. Right of the top we realized that the waiter was less than eager to serve us. We ordered drinks and our food, food took longer than what we expected even with a big group. The server never filled up our water glasses and kept forgetting things we asked for. To make matters worse, the manager seemed to notice our struggles so he came over and asked what we needed, we told him and to our surprise he never came back with what we asked. Worst part, we were so ready to leave and couldn't, our checks where laying at a table next to us but we must have waited 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and pick them up.   I am rating it 3 stars because the place was clean and the food here might have been okay but the terrible service didn't let us enjoy it.
Oregano's on Camelback is one of our favorite places to go for dinner & some beers. We always take out of town guests there.  The outdoor seating in particular is one of our favorite places to hang out, eat and drink. You can enjoy your food while relaxing in an oasis-like environment outside, enjoying the breeze, the sun or a sunset. Good music is always playing (jazz and other boppy tunes) and they have heaters over the tables outside for when it gets cold at night.  They have a decent beer and wine selection, including some good ones for beer connoisseurs. Pitchers of beer pricing is reasonable.  The food is fantastic. For appetizers, we really like the Guacatoni (quesadilla served with fresh guac) and the spicy ravioli's. Pizza lovers will love their selection of pie types and calzones. There's also a good variety of pastas and salads.  For us, it doesn't get much better then Oregano's. Yes, the place is usually crowded and you'll have to wait for a table. Yes, there are birds tweeting and hopping around outside, but we love the atmosphere and the food and drinks.
The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!
I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then, but no such luck.  The beds here are ROCKS!  It felt like I was sleeping on a box spring instead of a mattress and a really had and painful one at that.  When we “got up” in the morning (that phrase in quotations as it implies we had a good night's sleep, which we didn't) my husband pointed out that the side of the mattress was slumping, so it was probably very old.  Definitely not Marriott standard.  Wireless internet was slow, but a CAT5 was provided in the room for laptops that got internet up to speed just fine.  Breakfast when I had it was good.  Perhaps previous reviewer came down late?  A little on the crowded side, but the biscuits were delicious.  All in all, the stay was great except for the beds, but unfortunately that's a HUGE thing that needs to be good when you're staying at a hotel.  Sorry guys.
Don't know what I ordered here but it was dirt cheap. Probably less than $3.  You get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy. There's an 80% chance that Sam could be serving you. Say hi.
I just moved my daughter into an apartment for college and stumbled on Farren's. We had a great burger and ice cold beer after a long drive and move in. I had the bacon feta blue cheese burger and it was terrific. Fries. onion rings and chips were all great. Service was very good. Thank you Farren's!
I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign
You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed “Ritz-Carlton”? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a “ritz carlton” official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations.
Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing.  Also, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide.  And they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.
If you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity, you might want to stop reading now.  This place will not be for you.... but for the free spirited, the Alwun House is the place to be this month for their Erotic Art Festival.  The exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight, (Feb. 8th) at 7pm.  Don't expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne. Do expect to see transvestites on 8 inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted, the body painted, the latex clad, and the goths. They create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics, cross dressers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists.  You can't immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling.
Oh, AJ's. If you didn't exist less than 3 blocks from my apartment, I would never go to you. Although you have high-class pretensions, and several amicable sommeliers, your employees are aware that you are a ripoff.  Case in point: I go to AJ's on St. Paddy's day, 2010, looking for some corned beef. 1 corned beef steak remains. About 2 pounds. Price: 25.00. When I lived in Oregon last year, I was able to get 4 pounds of corned beef (a very cheap cut and preparation of beef) for under $10. I mentioned the price gouging to the guy behind the meat counter, and I quote: “Hahahahahahahaha!!!” -- Nothing else. No joke. They know they're overpriced. They sell the exact same things as food city for 4x the price (same company owns fry's, food city, and AJ's) because they know that a tamale will be something the whitebread customers of AJ's will consider a delicacy unavailable outside of the Spanish Mass at their local catholic church, and worthy of more than $2 apiece.  Furthermore, more whole and organic foods are sold at any one Sprouts, Trader Joe's, Fresh and Easy, and Whole Foods than any AJ's that ever existed.  Avoid this place unless you're a yuppie with too much money and not enough sense, or unless you think one of the sommeliers is hot. 2 stars for the awesome beer selection.
This shelter is fantastic and has generally very good, friendly people on staff.  The cats and dogs appear to be treated at least as well as one might expect.  When I adopted one of my cats at this establishment, I had to return the next day to have her spayed.  They did it for free, which was great, but the reason they don't get five stars is that the desk clerk completely forgot about my cat and me, and she left us waiting as she chatted on her cell phone with a friend: she only remembered about us as she was walking out for a smoke and saw us sitting in the lobby.
Such a nice & fun zoo. The kids lived it!!!
This is my new favorite HT. It's almost always crowded, but it's worth it!  The selection is better than most HTs, and the prices are even better. How the price can be different one HT 3 miles away from another HT is beyond me, but I've definitely noticed.   Other differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others, and everything looks bright and clean. Who doesn't love shiny??  The HT in Matthews has a better local produce selection, but higher prices on everything else.  You can't win them all, I suppose.
What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!   ”Would you care for some dessert?”, Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine. This place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return. Finally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.
Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check.   I just wanted to try their salad.   Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?  Wendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you.
I love Chicago hot dogs. I have loved them since I was a wee girl. Therefore, any place that makes a real deal, Vienna beef, loaded Chicago dog is aces in my book.   Is Matt's the best Chicago dog I've ever had? No. Is Matt's the best Chicago dog in Charlotte? Maybe. For those who are not up to speed on a traditional Chicago dog, it consists of: an all beef frank, onions, uber green relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomato and a pickle spear hugged into a poppy seed bun. Matt's definitely delivers on these components. The dog was a bit snappy, like I enjoy, and all the condiments were fresh and tasty.   The Hot Dog Meal Deal (#1) came with the loaded Chicago dog, a drink and your choice of fries or chips for $6.22. I went with the fries and I have to say, I was a little bit disappointed...they were a little smushy. You can also read Tonya's most recent review on her description of the fries. Regardless though, I enjoyed my hot dog so much that I will overlook the limp fries.   I definitely want to come back and try a few other menu items...I see a cheesy beef in my future.
I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong!  Now, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.
DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!  My husband went to get a manicure and they cut his finger and he got sever INFECTION and it is very swollen!! He had to go to the doctor today!
Thought the staff was incredibly rude. With out anyone else in the restaurant, my party of four was asked to wait. After we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together. My seafood portofino dish had about a cup of  oiling the bottom of the plate
Colin M. did a masterful job filling you in on the facts about this business, so check out his review.  I can only second what he said.    This is a real camera shop, stocked to the gills with lots of top-of-the-line stuff.  It would be easy to be intimidated but don't let that keep you from going into this fine establishment.  I have bought a few things here and they have always been very helpful and friendly.  You can find better prices on the internet, but no instant gratification on the internet.  And who is going to help you with a problem or answer a question when you have one?  Who will repair or clean your camera for you?  No, we need to support our local shops and if it means paying a few percentage points more, it's worth it.
Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!
Craving Thai-ish and need a quick lunch? Hit up Bangkok Ocha, son.   I met hubs here for a very speedy lunch where their lunch special includes iced tea, house soup and a noodle dish w/egg roll for $7.95. Oh, and it comes out in about 10 minutes flat. That's fast.   And the food? Not too shabby! The house soup is a total bust for me - it's a corn egg drop soup. Yeah. Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat!   The service is quick and efficient and they definitely know how to turn those tables around during lunch time! While it's not my favorite Thai food in Charlotte, it's a nice quick and affordable option in South Charlotte.
The store reeks of rotting fish, the security guards watch you like a hawk and the food selection is the worse I've seen in any Giant Eagle in the city.  One plus if you must shop here there are plenty of jitney drivers waiting for you to come out to offer you a ride.  That can be a big help if you are like me and don't have a car. “Need a car” haha some things about living in the hood just never change.   With this being the closet G E to Downtown and PNC Park and Heinz field I would think they would renovate but it's been years and still no change.
How this place stays in business I have no idea. Food is gross,  the place is empty all the time, small dishes, over priced. Service is totally crap. The parking lot  looks like a place one could get raped in. If you're handicapped you are screwed one parking space for the whole building. Pot holes everywhere, I can't believe they haven't been sued yet for the condition of the parking lot.
I've  reviewed another Cracker Barrel in the past, and this location lives up to the all-american constant that I've come to expect from Cracker Barrels. Its a tradition for my sister and I to have a meal at Cracker Barrel when I come to visit her, so we headed straight over there when I got off the train yesterday morning. I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours! Our server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great. You know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it? This wasn't the case. It was all piping hot and fresh. The odds were ever in our favor.
4 stars for Hardee's ?!?  It's no Culver's by a long shot but that Thick Burger was damn tasty !   I don't know if the restaurant was clean but the drive thru service was good.
Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.  As a middle aged man I purposely chose Dr. Austin because she is smart, compassionate, listens, thorough and has never once said “fully booked” when I've asked to see her for ANY reason that day.  If you are looking for a great doctor, Dr. Austin is it 100%.
Recently joined the YMCA and this is my “home” ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.  I will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting, slamming weights, flexing in the mirror.  I also  find it entertaining to see the fashion show that occurs in the weight room (I like to ppl watch between sets).   I have NEVER seen so many coordinated work clothes in my entire life.  Matching shows, pants/shorts/shirts and often times hats.  None of this bothers me, it is just entertaining.  I have not met anyone very friendly there and I assume that is because it is the “SoPark” area - but since I don't go to the gym to socialize I guess it doesn't matter.
This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh.
The first time I came here, I waited in line for 20 minutes.  When it was my turn, I realized I left my wallet in the car.  It hurt so bad, I didn't come back for a year.  I can walk to this place from my house- which is dangerous because those biscuits are just OH SO DREAMY.  I can't describe them.  Just get some.  Do I feel guilty about noshing on fabulous Strawberry Napoleons and Jewish Pizza (kind of like a modified, yet TOTALLY delicious fruitcake bar) at 10:15am?  Hecks, naw... But they do have quiche and some other breakfast-y items for those who prefer a more traditional approach to your stomach's opening ceremony.  Just go early :)  They open at 10 on Saturdays.  And bring cash...it's easier that way.
I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.  I had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.
In my opinion, Duke is destroying the environment in North Carolina as well as other states it operates in. The Dan River will never be the same and due to owning several politicians, they only cleaned up a fraction of the coal ash they spilled into the River.
If I could give this place a negative star I would! I have been coming here for years the service is has done a nose dive in the ground!!!! The service has is HORRIBLE now ! Went there for take out when I got home the order was completely  wrong the one thing they did get right was cold! I called let them know what was my order was incorrect and went back to wait another 15 minutes for them to correct it. I told them that part of my order was COLD and they said they would not replace it because it was what I ordered and there  was nothing wrong with the food it was just cold.  The manger or what they hired as a manger said she could reheat my food  and to replace it would cost them money to replace it. I asked  for a refund and she was NOT going to give me my money back. Finally she went into the back and asked some other person what to do which he seemed to have so sort of customer service. He told her to give me a gift card for the amount of the of the food! What I am going to do with a gift card to a place I am not coming back to!!! When asked to speak with him she told me he was not the manger but yet he seemed to tell her what to do !  It's a shame I expect this type of service from a large chain but not from a small business  ! Sad to say but I will not be returning and I will be telling others so they don't get ripped off!
This place use to be nice to eat at.  Now it's a dive!  The restaurant is filthy, I got a water glass with Lipstick on it and our coffee cups had dried cranberry juice on it.  I've been there multiple times thinking “it's just an off day”,  The last time I went there was a week ago when a friend was visiting from Palm Springs and I have to say, I was embarrassed after taking him there!  They got his order wrong, our dishes were dirty and the waitress seemed annoyed that we even mentioned it.  I will never go there again.
15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag, there is only half a sandwich? WTF? I go back and they acknowledge the mistake and proceed to make a half sandwich with and old piece of bread that was likely left over from lunch 5 hours prior.  There are too many places in this area to mess up that bad on a simple sandwich order to go back and try it again.
I wasn't supposed to be in Charlotte, but canceled flights, etc.  You know how that goes, so I spent several hours here.  Things I like about this airport:  Interesting food options, and what I had was good.  I never expected to be eating tasty BBQ Brisket, Beans, Cornbread & Fried Pickles at an airport restaurant.    Rockers.  All over the place there are rocking chairs.  Clean, open feel to the architecture.  Smoothly operating airport.  Wireless.  Basically, if you have to be stuck at an airport, I'd take this one over many others!
Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)    Lol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.  dmo out.
Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!
I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.  Service was really slow but the waitress was authentic.  Not the best review since I ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good & fresh.  I tried the sweet potato fries too.  The fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance.
Horrible service, inedible food, tremendous swivel factor. But, my drink was fine.  Their advertised drink specials are good, but most concentrated on shots and low-end liquors (think Smirnoff for $3). The “service” at the bar was hard to come by, although there were at least two bartenders working.  I asked for a minute with the menu, and spent the next 20 minutes trying to flag down a bartender to take my food order.  Ordered the shrimp special which was not very special at all.  Although there were 6 grilled shrimp that were actually pretty good, the rest of the plate was a mess of flavorless, watery rice pilaf and a virtual stalk of broccoli, steamed but otherwise unadorned.  At $12.99 it was definitely not a good value.  Plus, it took for-ev-er to arrive. The gentleman next to me ordered the meatloaf special, and his cafeteria-style serving arrived in about 30 seconds.  That didn't make me very happy for him, however, as it looked equally disgusting.  I cannot recommed this place for anything other than a drink, although the pool players seemed to be having a good time.
Being from Southern California, the “scene” is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable.
Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive.   At least at Chuck E Cheese, the kids can run around and bang gophers on the head, or whatever, while you're waiting. Here, you just kind of bang your own head on the table.
Great tasting food. Me and my wife were trying to find a great chinese restaurant that we could enjoy together since all the other ones we went to were not that great. We ordered Lemon Chicken with their chicken fried rice. Really big portions to share so we only needed one order of each! It was delicious!! The food got to us within 15minutes! Awesome atmosphere and nice service! Only problem is limited parking!
My mom called me so giddy on the phone today, I thought she was going to tell me she won the lottery.  No.  Her sofa from Gene Sane arrived.  It made her just as happy.    She and I went to Gene Sane a few months ago and found fabric for a sofa and chair.  The fabric was not inexpensive.  Some of that they have is really beautiful designer fabric, some of it is not so special and I am convinced could be found elsewhere for less.  However, they did have excellent customer service throughout the entire upholstering process.  And my parents ended up getting two sofas and three chairs done there.  My parents live in Oakland in a condo building with a ridiculously small elevator.  Gene Sanes went above and beyond to make sure this extremely long sofa from my grandma would fit in the elevator at my parents' building.  They brought the sofa mid-upholstery to the building just to make sure it would fit into the elevator.  That is such great customer service it is ridiculous.  It did fit, which is great, but their backup plan was to upholster it as two pieces which would then seamlessly be fit together as one inside the apartment.  This is the kind of stuff that high end places in NYC know how to do and even though they ended up not having to do it in this case, it was good to know they have the skills to do so.  They were also great with attention to detail of lining up all the stripes on all the cushions both front and back.  These are the kinds of things that make a big difference.
yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.  i made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more.
This has to be the most ghetto and disrespectful dive I've ever been to. I usually don't play the race card, but unless you are a Spanish speaking Latino you will not be treated well by the staff.  As soon as I walked up to the counter, a pregnant cashier rolled her eyes and asked dully what I wanted. I couldn't pronounce the name of the combo I wanted but I blurted out the number associated with it and it had a picture. She looked over her shoulder at one of her associates and said something. The only words I caught were “token gringo customer.”  They shared a giggle.  They were speaking in that half-assed Spanish that has a little English mixed in. Suffice it to say I was offended and promptly cancelled the order. I have not returned since then
Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.  Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in.
It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes, I feel old considering I remember changing her diapers!) and I wanted to do something special for her. I considered using one of the online services (ProFlowers, 1-800 Flowers, etc.) but I really wanted the “wow” effect of the flowers arriving all arranged and gorgeous. So (of course) I turned to Yelp and found Cactus Flowers.   They have a great website showing photos of all their arrangements (see “Cactus Flower Exclusives” for prearranged, local delivery options), and they even offer national deliveries through FTD. I found a gorgeous bouquet and even had the option of adding balloons, chocolates, and a teddy bear. I went with the balloons because I was sending them to my sister's school and I just HAD to go for the best (AKA most embarrassing) visual display possible!!   I placed the order yesterday (hooray for next-day delivery - and even same-day delivery if you order before 1pm) and realized today that I did not specify delivery time. Having the flowers arrive after she's left school for the day isn't the surprise I was going for!! So I sent them an email explaining the situation and asked ever so nicely that they please try to deliver before 2pm. Just over an hour later, which was after noon in Arizona - less than 2 hours before my requested delivery time - I received a response that it was taken care of. How great is that?!?!   I'm still waiting to get a call from my sister (I'm sure I'll post an update later today to say how it turned out), but right now they have a very satisfied customer!   The Cactus Flower Exclusives are gorgeous and go for $35 and up (+ tax and delivery, which is $13 - $15). National deliveries also start at $35 + tax and delivery.   - 1 Star because the bouquet arrangements most people lean towards start at about $50, which is kinda pricey (only smaller arrangements with a handful of short stem flowers in a short vase are $35)
Hm, didn't realize Bar Bianco had their own review page.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix#hrid:PvdncjR2V1mDcLIPIGJ73Q  In short, awesome rustic feeling re-purposed house, smoking hot bartender woman, relaxed and comfy country style patio, and delicious Four Peaks on tap.
This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc.   The food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor.   I did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich. So I was like dang! I should've ordered that. My return is questionable. If I go back its only going be for the fish sandwich & oysters!
First time here.  I'll give credit where it's due, they have apparently been reading the reviews because the staff made an extra effort to be friendly and courteous.   I had 2 bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork.  While eating my sandwiches I had the thought there should be laws enacted to constitute what restaurants can call bbq.  Boiled meat covered in BBQ sauce is NOT BBQ.   I grew up in the South, I've been to Memphis in May a couple of times, so my standards for BBQ are admittedly higher than average, but this was not even close to real BBQ.  Was it decent food.  Sure.  Decent, at best.  Was it the reason I got an upset stomach a couple hours later, possibly.   I don't care about the old decor, dirty looking bathrooms or anything else, if the food was good I would go back.  It wasn't.
Great location, nice quaint studio, pretty good prices. Patrick is a world class yoga teacher - his classes are the BEST
Never had any experience with rudeness here, or any other problem. They make the best beans and greens around (and I order this dish at every Italian restaurant) - brothy, just the right amount of saltiness, and just right for sopping up whatever's left on the plate with their delicious crusty bread.  The salad with Gorgonzola is also pretty amazing.  A great neighborhood standby.
Honestly wish I could give it zero stars based on today... ? Security is beyond the worst. Check in with the airline was smooth, thats about it. I'm sure its not this bad everyday, or it would be on the news and or shutdown from the lack of business....
Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy.  That must be the problem with Radio Maria.  The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.    The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean?  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style?  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.  This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.  Stay away!
I finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous Christmas gift!! Ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first!!  We sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and I started with the Pineapple Stoli Doli and it is dangerous! I could have had like 10...I didn't but i could have! We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good.   For my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good, but like my friend said there was nothing that made it OMG!! We also had the Onion Rings, and Sauteed Spinach which were also good.  We had the Creme Brulee for dessert and that was perfectly lighter than I thought it was going to be and just the right amount of sweetness to finish the dinner.  Our server was very nice and helped when it came to picking out the wine and his suggestion was great we all enjoyed it!
Interesting museum in uptown. From California so it is always interesting to learn about the history of the south. Great family location for an outing to make the day also educational. Brought my daughter who enjoyed the interaction displays that made the experience more fun.
I had not taken my family to RR in quite some time.  Everyone was in the mood for burgers so it seemed like a good fit for a relatively inexpensive Friday night dinner.  Pulling in the parking lot I was surprised at the lack of business - that should have been my first clue.  We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken.  Then we waited.  And waited.  Finally our drinks arrived and our order was taken.  We ordered a small appetizer and bowl of soup with our meals.  Again, we waited.  Our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup.  It was mediocre, and sadly, the best food we would have that evening.  Our entrees arrived shortly after.  It was then my husband asked if he could have his bowl of soup.  Soon after the waitress arrived with a half filled bowl.  It almost looked as though it had been full at one point, then dumped out.  The fries were cold on all our meals.  The burger I ordered well done, was extremely pink. I did not bother to ask for it to be corrected because at this point the whole experience was quite laughable.  More than halfway through our entrees, a gentlemen in what appeared to be a manager's uniform, came to the table with a bowl of soup asking if it was ours.  My husband laughed and told him, “No, I already got this half full bowl.”  A few moments later I bit into something hard, like bone, in my burger.  At that point I was disgusted - and done.  I would have told the waitress that the food (and service) was awful, but we were never asked.  When she brought the bill she said she had taken the soup off the bill since it was only a 1/2 bowl.  So my husband's comment must have at least made it back to her, yet there was no apology for it, nor the fact that he had to ask for it and received it after his entr\u00e9e.  $58.00 for 3 people, lackluster/slow service and terrible food?  No thanks RR.  We won't be back.
We ate tonight at Nitaya, and our food was excellent.  I had the Pineapple Chicken Curry and my wife had a Modified Number 77.  We had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and Mango for dessert.  The only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated, but for authentic Thai, this was it.  The service was great and no problems with English understanding him or us.
Unfortunately, they are out of business.  Looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago.  I have eaten there twice and it was very good. Don;t know why they closed but they had a Thank You banner posted for their customers.   Too bad.
This Goodwill is probably the busiest in Charlotte and has above-average selection in each dept.  They have good variety of clothes, shoes, books, furniture, and housewares.  The selling point at this store (as you might have guessed by reading my views) is the book selection.  Unlike other stores, they have a steady rotation of new titles, nearly new for really cheap.  I'm regularly surprised by their furniture selection.  If my house wasn't cluttered like your grandma's crib, I would pick up a table or even a couch here!  Also, this place is freakin' Mecca for used appliances.  I always see a selection of used microwaves, coffee makers, and blenders.  The clothes are nice, not as nice as the Matthews Plantation, but you can still find some amazing deals on brand name clothes.    Please be warned: Saturdays is NOT a good day to shop due to crowds of crying, screaming children.  Plus, you wouldn't want to get in altercation with aggressive shoppers over a $1 beer stein.  Try a weekday before 6 or so.  Happy treasure hunting!
The Bridges has become my default golf course for meeting up with friends and getting in 18.  It is a city-owned course on the northeast side of Madison, south of the airport.  Most of the course is situated amidst low-lying wetlands, while on the back nine a couple of holes rise up on a ridge along Anderson Avenue.  It is an fairly easy course to walk, except that the proximity to water does mean a good amount of mosquitoes.  The recent rains led to a lot of flooding on the course, but I played last weekend and much of the course is back in playable condition.  I especially like the Bridges since the course can either reward you or punish you, but there always seems to be a bit of both.  Other courses are either too hard or too easy (mostly too hard) but the Bridges is the kind of course where after being embarrassed on a deceptively difficult par three you find yourself in position to birdie a par four that initially looked impossible.  It's enough of a challenge to keep you coming back without demoralizing you, and this makes it about the most fun of the courses in the area.   The major downside to the Bridges is the proximity to the airport.  Most of the course is right on the flight path for landing jets, and this is distracting at first.  Once you've played a round or two you learn to time your drives or putts, and Dane County Regional isn't exactly O'Hare.  Another potential problem is that this course can and will eat a lot of balls if like me you tend toward inaccuracy.  The vegetation in the O.B. areas is thick reedy wetland stuff, so just go ahead and consider that ball lost.  Lastly, the course can get very crowded and play tends to slow.  However, since I prefer to walk this usually works in my favor.  For some these drawbacks are a deal-breaker, but given the crowds on any given weekend I have to assume that this is a minority opinion.  The price is very reasonable - from $22 to $37 walking 18 depending on the time.  There is a twilight special where after 6:00 PM you can golf as much as you would like for $10.  The only problem with this is that a lot of people get in line for this and the rate of play is pretty slow.  The bar and grill in the clubhouse is one of my favorites of the city-owned courses.  The bar is well stocked and they usually have a couple of decent taps.  The last time I was there I enjoyed the new Capital Prairie Gold from a frosty mug.  You can always count on getting a can of Capital out on the course as well.  The menu is surprisingly broad and well-made.  The wraps are a satisfying end to the round, as are the sandwiches and the appetizers.  You can call in an order as you make the turn and it will be ready at the clubhouse, which is perfect for when only one or two of the foursome are eating.  Several of my friends have attended banquets or luncheons held here and have said these are well done too.  I think that top to bottom, the Bridges has about the best layout of the city-owned courses and is my personal favorite.
Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later.   I kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.  I like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.
I can't say my expectations were too high, but I definitely expected better.  My cashew chicken was inedible, and I was only able to eat the fried rice and egg roll (which were fine).  The chicken was so chewy that I could not bring myself to take a second bite.  Will not go back.
Maybe the current economy has forced Tacos de Juarez to make some cutbacks in the quality of their food, because our recent experience was nowhere near as good as everyone else seems to have had. We live mere blocks from here, so we felt it was about time we tried it.   The chips and tostada base tasted off, as if the oil they were fried in was a little rancid. The cheese on the cheese crisp was plentiful- and pretty oily. My husband called the cheese in his chile relleno the most tasteless he had ever had, as was the relleno batter.   I ordered a #1, but wanted to substitute a hard taco for the cheese enchilada. I checked the a la carte prices, and knew that the taco was actually less expensive, so I was sure I wasn't going to be screwing them over. I can't tell you how long it took me to try and explain what I wanted to our server. I'm sure there are those who would say it's my fault for not speaking Spanish. Anyway, I ended up getting my tostada and the hard taco, but no taquito, and no rice and beans. Then another 10 minutes of my life went by as I tried to explain again what I had ordered when the server asked if everything was alright, but that really, no one needed to bring me out any more food. I had had enough by that point and knew it would already be a Pepcid AC kind of night. The cook and the server argued and finally the server understood that she had gotten my order wrong. They comped my food, which wasn't necessary, but they insisted. My taco and tostada were just alright. The beans in the tostada were cold, which I am not used to.  We've had everything better somewhere else, and feel no need to return.
Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.  Stepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies.   One of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.  Maybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.  So, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's.
I've been to this place over 100 times over the years of working uptown and just checked in for the first time. The staff here is great and friendly, the service is quick and its not very pricey. I love the chips and salsa and Mexican pizza and come quiet often for the breakfast.
Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte, I'd heard that Maharani was a cheaper but tasty option, so we ordered from there a few nights ago.   Copper is definitely still my place, but Maharani was fine enough. First of all, the food came very quickly, which is rare. Usually indian food, good indian good, takes at least 30-45 minutes. We got our order in like 30, which was great 'cause we were starving.   The Tikka Masala was spicy and pretty good, but it wasn't as thick and saucy as i like. The salad was just so-so. The Naan were all amazing. Definitely the highlight.
One of my favorite veggie sandwiches ever!  The sandwich is called “Where's the Beef?” and any menu planner / company owner with a sense of humor is A-OK in my book!  Comes with tomatoes, celery, sprouts, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, jicama, and pinenuts.  I recommend adding spicy mustard and havarti cheese.  Great place for a downtown lunch.  There are lots of places that do sadwiches.  I go to Jacquees for good Boar's Head meat, I go to Sticklers for the delicious fresh bread, and I go to D&D for the unique hot and signature sandwiches on their menu.  Soups change daily, as does a flavored tea, staff is hit or miss on friendliness.  Today I got to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup and was impressed! Then again, how can you go wrong with a creamy chicken soup with that tangy, spicy buffalo flavor? The good news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. The bad news: I could probably eat 3 bowls. Calorie counters - stay away from this soup!  D&D can get very busy around noon, along with many of the downtown places.  I suggest calling in your order if you don't want to wait -OR- you can even use their website to order online.  Cool!!
Even a NYer was telling me to get tacos here, so I did. Pretty good. Loaded more than I'm used to. They make their own tortillas which is respectable. It's fun to watch people order tacos here, this is a real taste of Mexico, and it seemed new to half of them. Pittsburgh is a great town because the vendors aren't afraid to give the people something real - they even have tongue.   That chinese food truck across the street though.... it's good, but way Americanized.
This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun, has reasonable prices and very good food.   Unfortunatley you can expect a wait of 1-2 hours seemingly anytime during the week, night or day. Even take-out usually takes over an hour!  I suppose that's evidence of the restaurant's overall quality, but their general nonchalant attitude about the situation has frustrated me to the point that I rarely even bother with the place anymore - which is too bad, because they probably have the best wings I've ever tasted.
Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don't even like wings usually, but Silky's knows how to cook 'em so they don't taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce, which is flavorful as well as hot.  I'd buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge, and everything I've had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer, sitting inside is painful.
Awesome tortillas, awesome salsa, pretty good selection of Latin American food products (mostly Mexican, but lots of S./Central American and Caribbean).  I'm spoiled from all the Hispanic grocery stores in Atlanta, but this is the best one I've found in the 'burgh.  Prices are average for the Strip and Pittsburgh, but a little high for a Hispanic grocery store.
First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC .
The worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.    Their watermelon mixed drink was very good though.  I won't be returning.
I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere.   Why I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on.   As mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one.   As other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment.   I haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.
Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history, then this place is great. This is not a place to go if you have young children that want to climb on everything. You are not even allowed to touch the railings that surround the fire trucks. The children's exhibit and the one firetruck that you are allowed to climb on seem like an afterthought.  Beware of the old men at the front as well, they don't seem too excited to have children there.
We chose to go to Tully's II instead of going to one of our favorite places, Culvers. Big mistake.... Around 7:30 on a Friday night we walk in to the sign that says “Please Seat Yourself”.  So we walk through the Pool Table area to get to the back dining area, since it was close to the salad bar.  After searching for a highchair for my son, with no help from the waitress filling the salad bar right next to us, we all sit down at a table.  A few moments after sitting down a waitress (Older Woman) came to our table. She took our drink order: two waters with lemon, a Sierra Mist and a chocolate milk, and disappeared.  She reappeared with our drinks a few minutes later.  The waitress takes our orders, Two Cod Fish Frys and a Perch Fish Fry.  We were informed that the salad bar was included with our meal.  Well... From the time we walked into Tully's II to the time we left they were stocking the salad bar, which is not a large spread.  After 10 minutes of watching this woman stock the salad bar at a snails pace and a distasteful look on her face, we had to ask for silverware and plates. Apparently the woman stocking it didn't seem to notice that they were all gone. I'm sure she thought it was nice that nobody was bothering her as she stocked the bar, not ever considering that nobody could eat from it even if they wanted to.  As my wife gets her first plate from the salad bar our meal shows up 20-25 minutes after placing our order.  Really? That long for a fish fry in Wisconsin?  Then came disappearing act two from our waitress!! The food consists of Heavily battered, greasy fish and tiny french fries.  No tartar sauce, no ketchup, no butter for the rolls on the table or salad bar.  We had to ask another waitress for some tarter sauce.  Another 20 minutes creeps slowly past as we waited for our waitress to come back to check and see if we may want a few more pieces of fish being the fact that we did order “All You Can Eat” fish.  At this point we have watched 3 other waitresses continue to mess around with this Salad Bar, chatting each other up and texting on their cell phones, while other tables are getting as frustrated as we are.  One table had to go to the Salad Bar to get food since nobody bothered to greet them at all. Our waitress later commented that she thought someone else had taken their order. Another table had to get up and walk to the kitchen to ask for their bill... they were lucky enough to have the same disappearing waitress we had.  We did notice that our waitress came out of the kitchen a number of times (7 to be exact) to bring things to the two tables closest to the kitchen. But anything past those two ... it's like we didn't even exist. and probably could have walked out without anyone ever noticing. Finally, only after the man asked for his bill, did our waitress reappear to ask if we wanted any more fish.  We mentioned at that time that it would be nice to have some ketchup even though most of our fries had been eaten at that point. We also asked for 3 Pieces of Perch, 4 pieces of baked Cod and a refill of Sierra Mist. Not too difficult to remember.  10 minutes later she comes to our table: 1 piece of Perch, 2 pieces of Cod, 3 pieces of  baked cod and no refill.  10 minutes after that our waitress came back to the table and before she could ask us anything, I immediately asked for our bill.  45 seconds later she returns with my card, the fastest thing this lady had done ALL night.  On our way out, we stopped to talk to a manager, briefly describing the WORST SERVICE we had ever had.  I paid first because I didn't want him to think we were trying to get anything free.  When we pointed out our waitress, he didn't look surprised.  All he had to say was “ I hope you come back and give us  another chance”, not “is there anything I can do to make it right?” or “come back and have a meal on us”..... nothing.  We walked out utterly disgusted!!  The only reason Tully's II is getting one star is because there is no ZERO star option.  Would not...would not.... would not recommend this place to anyone.. EVER.  Monona's best Fish Fry...my Foot.  Monona has poor standards if this is the best in town.
This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants that reminds me a lot of the little Italian family style restaurants you can find in little Italy and other places around NYC. I come here about 3-4 times a month to get my Italian fix:) The staff is super friendly and treats you like your family. The owner, Richard, is often there and loves to talk so get ready for a great conversation about the history of the restaurant etc!  Its a very small restaurant and seating is limited. I personally like sitting inside because its warm and cozy! There is outside seating but it looks out onto a shopping center parking lot which to me is not appealing to me at all. The food here is AMAZING! Portions are quite large and can easily be spit in half to share. They have been on the TV show Diner, Drive-ins and Dives, which is where I got my motivation to make the drive over there. I would recommend the calamari to start and/or the bruschetta, which offers 4 choices of toppings. For the main course I always get the Spagetti Neri, which is squid ink pasta with a TON of seafood. If you like seafood this is definitely the dish for you! The Bolognese is also an excellent choice. To top it off at the end of my meal I like to take a conolli, which is always made fresh and oh so yummy!
We took our in-laws here while they were visiting from out of state. This was on their to do list of local experiences. It was also my first time here since moving to the valley. Nobody was disappointed.    We came for lunch on a Thursday around noon. We were able to get metered parking right in front of the place. There is a lot in back that charges $5.00 as well.They were about 30% full. We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress immediately. They brought a highchair for the baby too.    I loved the d\u00e9cor. Classic rock and roll memorabilia was the theme. Many of Alice Cooper's own items decorated the wall from tour posters to guitars. There were several large screen TVs and classic rock and roll music was playing as well. The waitresses were dresses in attire that also supported the theme.    The menu feature's items with a celebrity theme. I ordered the “Adam Richman's bases loaded big unit” and a local micro brew. The food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. This was a 1 lb., 22” loaded hotdog with a good order of fries. The hot dog was an all beef hotdog on a bun loaded with sauerkraut, “nightmare” chili, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and shredded cheddar cheese. It was more than I could hope to eat, but I did do serious damage. After I got a to go box, we browsed the gift shop. Everything Alice was available.   This place isn't for everybody who is not into the genre. We did enjoy it and will return on special occasions. If you go make it a week day for lunch. It's probably when you'll get best for service. They are located near Chase Field, so they are probably packed on game day. The menu is a little pricy, but worth the experience.
Well, I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!
Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths?   My favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving . Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies.    At the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children . To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)
If it's a GREAT bowl of traditional Japanese noodle soup you're in search of, this is it.   I'm sold solely on their noodle soup bowls that I haven't tried any of their other entrees. The bowls are big, you get a good amount for your buck in my opinion.   The TanTan Men is good if you're looking for a spicy soup. The Miso is great if you're feeling a seafood soup. The Hakata soup; you will not go wrong ordering this bowl. The noodles, the broth. So good. The Cha-shu; is the Hakata but with MORE delicious pork included, you can't go wrong. And even if you don't normally eat a lot you'll have a hard time not wanting to eat the entire bowl. At least that's what I've experienced.   Because the place is popular and the space is small, you may have to wait awhile for service and to put in your order, but once you receive your delicious bowl of goodness you will quickly forget!
Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!
I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.  Also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average. I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I would strongly tell anyone I know not to order from there either.
My friend and I went last night to Bombay Grille. We started with samosa (she ordered and oh boy what a good choice). They are very filling and come as two big pieces. I ordered chicken palak. It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was very prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home...
If 0 stars were possible I'd give em. Got back from here yesterday evening and I am physically ill.   I didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.  Speaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.  This guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??!   Worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest.   I'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!
I'm visiting Charlotte for work and found this place through restaurant.com.  I'm glad I did!  I went with a friend from the area who was a little weary about its location but was pleasantly surprised by the inside.  It's cute and quaint with a touch of modern flair.  We each started with a martini as they are all $4 dollars on Thursdays (normally $7-9).  The waters didn't actually come until after the martinis which is a little backwards, but the martinis were welcomed with open arms - and were yummy!  The food came out quickly and hot... I ordered the pasta primavera with creamy pesto and added shrimp.  It was nicely flavored, it was chalk full of goodies and the portion was more than enough.  I was disappointed that I didn't have a fridge in my hotel to take home the leftovers!  My friend ordered the grits.  Definitely a good dish but I would not recommend it to those who don't like spicy food because it had quite a cajun kick.  All in all a good experience.  Check it out!
Don't go to this store!  The service is always poor: the people working there are unfriendly, don't know what they are selling, where anything is located, and to top it off you are likely to be overcharged.  So if you do go you best check your receipt.  Plus they tend to get in your face when questioned about store policy.  Sure they have the food I want but I can get it in a different “friendly” store.  Lose the attitude!  What ever happened to good quality customer service?
My family has been coming to Penn Mac for as long as I can remember. My parents make monthly trips to stock up on their very large array of cheeses. The prices are fantastic. For example, parmigiano reggiano at Whole Foods is 19.99 per lb; at Penn Mac it is 14.99 per lb. The service is great, the array of products are huge, and as stated before, the prices are great.   My favorite products to purchase are:  All cheeses Deli meats Canned tomatoes Pasta ”00” flour Cashews Olive oil
Yes, I am reviewing a Starbucks.  The reason for this review was for the exceptional service I received here this past weekend.  My wife has been saving the points up on her Starbucks rewards card (a gold card). It turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within 30 days on your card now, and they can not be stored and used when ever you like. So instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use, we only had 1 free one. The employee at the counter explained this new rule to us, and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size/ any kind of our choice.  It was truly awesome customer service! So thank you lady employee behind the register this last Easter Sunday around noon.  Other things I noticed about this Starbucks, it was very clean, a well organized pastry/muffin area. There is no drive thru, so that kinda sucks. I counted at least 3 people working behind the counter, so staffed properly. Our drinks were made quick and tasted great!  4 out of 5 only because it is a Starbucks and there are just so many of them (its not original).  Again, excellent customer service!
My review is for the bakery.  Did you know Safeway has a delicious carrot cake?  I ordered a half sheet for an office function.  I arrive at Safeway and the cake is not ready.  The lady who took my order failed to write down what kind of cake I wanted (minus the one-star).  The young woman who ended up helping me was very concerned and apologetic.  She was able to decorate a carrot cake for me farily quickly and did a wonderful job.  Very refreshing to see that some people still take pride in doing a good job.
If you get nothing else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly delicious. I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful.   I just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. The environment is comforting and warm. I love the lights strewn along the windows! They just add to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased with their choices. The green curry was a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and the veggies were nice and crisp.  They were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite of my friend's and I was sad that I was too full to have a dessert of my own!   As we rolled out of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in the city!
My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, “I'm sorry for the misunderstanding”.....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......
Went in today no appointment, and Jimmychoo was able to do my back-fill in under 40 minutes because I was in a hurry.  They look fantastic!! Will definatly be going back!
Based purely on service. . .  10 people (3 groups),  10 minutes,  6 empty tables,  2 servers,  0 eye contact,  0 acknowledgement to  people waiting to sit.  Horrible,  maybe burgers are good,  but I do not like being ignored.
The food was okay but some of the staff are very rude and uncourteous. I had a very unpleasant encounter during lunch time once when the person serving the food demanded a better tip from me when I was leaving the restaurant!!! I had actually tipped him fairly well and I think it is very unprofessional to vocally demand for more money even otherwise! He did not seem to care that I was a regular at the restaurant before this incident and I have decided never to visit the place again.
I've gotten massages from Modern Salon several times, and loved them all there... until the last time, when I lost my penchant- after learning the masseuse I had used before, no longer worked there. His replacement was a woman who did nothing but make me more tensed up than when I came in! It wasn't until after I already paid for the service, gave her a tip and went home, that I started thinking in retrospect... then got mad that I actually paid for something that made me feel WORSE. It was some time ago, so I will have to call them to see if her name's on record, so I can recommend not using her. I don't think she listened to a word I said. I had the 1-hour massage, and I explained to her before hand, that I wanted her to mainly focus on my upper back & neck, because I had a lot of pain in the area from working on the computer 24/7 until finishing a job that week. I also told her I prefer harder pressure. I have never had a “massage” like that before. She did nothing but tickle me. I told her at least twice that she can use more pressure, but I guess she didn't care... then she ends up paying the LEAST amount of attention to my problem areas I asked her to focus on. I guess I was being too nice? I should have asked for someone else, but I didn't want to hurt her feelings.   I haven't had a massage there since then, but I love getting my haircuts there. I've had a few different stylists, but loved each one. They were especially helpful when I had to undergo chemotherapy treatments, which made me lose all of my hair. When it finally started growing back in, it was a mess... they helped my hair to look & feel so much better and healthier.   The staff are all friendly and pleasant. The spa (upstairs) is nice and separated from the more chaotic salon and registers. The spa's waiting area is comfy and quiet, and the dressing rooms/showers/sauna room is nice, and offers a nice assortment of Aveda products to test out.
Decent drinks + chill atmosphere + Irish Nachos (oh God yes) + lack of sketchy people grinding on you = WIN.
I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.  A few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer “The Wheel”, which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some “rules”, but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.
MALL CLOSED  June 30, 2010  RIP
I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand.
typically i'm not a huge fan of artifact and cultural exhibits.  However, the Heard experience was beyond expectations.   The 7.50 student price was reasonable and we were instantly put on a walking tour around the museum. The guides were excellent and the museum is quite historic.     The contemporary art pieces are not quite art museum worthy.  However the katina doll collection was awesome.  They have Barry Goldwater's personal collection of Katina dolls on display !    I highly suggest using the guided tours,  because some of the exhibits are difficult to process.
Stellar! One of my favorite places to eat in all of Phoenix. Sunday Happy Hour is rock solid - $5 small plates (many) and half price wine.   The menu covers everything you could want - steak, chicken, fish, sandwiches, veggies, etc... I have eaten a wide variety of items and have never been disappointed.   You should stop reading this and go there. Pony up to the bar and enjoy yourself.
Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However, the pricing really is low when you're lazy. The wait is ridicious at times. I would recommend the Shadyside location over the other two. It's more clean and better parking. Cash only.
awesome burgers.  decent service.  good atmosphere.  it's a dive bar.  just fyi.  with good food.
A little house filled with delicious food, quaint seating and a cute patio. This pretty much sums of Coronado Cafe. I have been wanting to visit Coronado Cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day! This little house also reminds me of a little elf's cottage but in a really cute way.   I like the food and atmosphere here. I tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it. It was the perfect tough. I really wanted to try the goat cheese salad, but there is always next time!
If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.  The meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.  Some of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.  Yay Monty's!
The store is small, but it carries specialties that are difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I was particularly excited to find middle eastern chili sauce and chocolate covered Turkish delights.
Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn't fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good, the naans (when fresh) were good, but mostly it all stunk.
Tried again and it was worse.  I didn't like it.  Ordered a combo plate beef burrito, soft taco and tostada. Took most of it home to try and remake it but it was hopeless. Just not good food.
Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be.   What I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment.   Stick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.
Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.  Then I was offered the “deal” of overdraft protection from the savings account for an annual fee plus a $10 transaction fee should this situation ever arise again.  Needless to say, I declined this deal and transferred the savings to the checking account where it sits until I find another bank and then fire Dollar.
Something different here.  Food, schmood, go there and drink the beers from the beer cave.  I don't think you have to wait for the server to open your beer, they'll notice and charge your accordingly.  It's all walk in and self service beer, why don't more places do that?!  Mike
Best Buy,you really suck. Tried to buy a camera the other day. Mid day,mid week,store pretty empty. 3 employees hanging around the camera department as I started to look at options. No one asked if they could help,in fact they first stopped their conversation in an attempt to become invisible. No problem,I'll poke around till I either find what I want ,or until I have comparison questions to narrow down choices. I think I have it,I'm ready to select. Where'd everyone go? I'm so lonely. I start to wander a bit and see if they're doing laundry in the appliance section. nope. Maybe around by the video cameras. Nope nope. Under a display cabinet? Nah,that would be silly... They were just gone. Poofed. Vanished. Vaporized. I decided it had to be the nefarious work of aliens. Yes,I said “nefarious”. I became frightened in my alone-ness Fearing next would be an invasion of the Apple People of the Crack Basha's. Who would protect me? The aliens abducted all the staff of Best Buy,so it would just be me. I couldn't possibly stop them all. They would come,snarling their toofless grimaces at me. I would be defenseless. Fearing my life and existance as I know it,I saw only 3 choices. 1)Face them all.Aliens and Apple People of the Crack Basha's.Fight till the end or vaporization. 2)Take what I wanted as there was no one left to stop me. 3)Make a hasty retreat and go elsewhere to purchase a camera. Gentle readers,as you read this harrowing tale,you can safely assume I chose plan #3. New camera in my possession,safe at home taking pictures of the pets grateful to have gotten out alive. Since all the help at Best Buy has been vaporized,you may want to go elsewhere if you'd like to purchase anything that isn't self serve. Remember to get a subscription to some crap magazine on your way out. Thank you,come again.
Planned to have lunch & a drink (alcohol) w/my dad & bf.  The server carded me (I'm 30!!!) , she “I can't take this ID, it's vertical”, when I gave her my (valid) license. I sat there till others were finished. Then I thought HEY! I have another (more recent) Government Issued ID! My Marijuana Medical License card w/my bday on it !!   The manager came out & told me... “I'm sorry we can't take this ID either, *nervous chuckles*, we recently had a meeting on this, we cant take any of these ID's, sorry, I do believe that you're you. I know, I've been having the same problem cuz I'm 21 and I just had to get another license to make it horizontal”   I said, “Are u kidding me? You won't give me a drink, even though you said u believe these ID's are me !?!! & my dad is right here.”    This is some bureaucratic bullshit!! WHY is Applebee's trying to FORCE me to go to the DMV, to get a 5$ license renewal, so it can be *horizontal* instead of vertical?!  Why the hell??? My card doesn't expire till 2049, whats the problem?  Applebee's, even when I do have *the right* direction of license card,  you will NOT be getting ANY buisiness from me!!  I ended up drinking water.
I am in town for work and I decided to order food from here. The food was awesome! I ordered the People's Special Biryani and they brought the food right to my hotel room. I will definitely order from here again the next time I'm in town.
GROSS!  I can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior, which was amazing and a very great experience. So I thought hey for my friends birthday coming up more people are coming I want to get an even better place so the Omni I thought would be great and it's right next to epicenter were made reservations at Flemings...  we took pictures of how disgusting the room looked! There was a cockroach wing, not in a corner, but in an obvious position on the middle of the floor. The chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained. I stayed at the Westin just 2 weeks before and the Omni couldn't even hold a candle to that place. I have no idea why they are considered a nice hotel? It is THE worst room I have ever stayed in ever.  There is NOTHING modern about the hotel, there is a difference in vintage style and just plain and out of date. The last time I saw a bathroom this small and out of date was spring break in Panama city and that was a cheap last minute hotel we had to take but at least it was right on the beach. I don't care how close this is to epicenter, it's NOT worth the price. We had friends from out of town that just couldn't believe how gross the room was. We only stayed one night. Thank God!  The front desk people were snarky and made you feel as if you were being judged, you have to walk by them any time you leave your room. The whole experience was awful and uncomfortable. I am going to post the pics
Nice airport with good dining choices. The US Airways Lounge is great too.
They seem to have everything. Obscure films, B films, foreign films, nearly every weird movie I've found out on the internet, they have it. (One time there was some anime I wanted to see but they didn't have, but they explained that all the copies out there were pirated, and they'd be happy to add it to their collection if I could find a legitimate source for them.)  Secondly... its pretty cheap if you buy a renters block.  I kind of wish there was a way to return videos without wading into campus, though.
Mixed review: chips and salsa were good, atmosphere good. I was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada. My food, vegetarian burrito/cheese enchilada combo, was really basic and had no imagination in flavor. I was hoping to get a taqueria style burrito but what I got was small and boring flavor. The guacamole was tasteless and frozen, previously made. It was shameful that they serve that. Outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular.
To be honest, this place sucks so much as compared to how it used to be. Like all vintage clothing stores, you have to dig through piles of crap to find that one diamond in the rough. Buffalo Exchange is no longer like that store. Now, you just dig through garbage and getting nothing out of it but a grimy feel and a fetid stench of indigence on your hands. I also found out, after selling some clothing here that Their selection here just sucks.  The only thing that's generally alright is their shoe selection. I got a pretty sweet pair of Nikes for $30.
This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.  Two of us ate the gyro platter which comes with:  hummus (watery)  pita (store bought)  gyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small)  Greek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing)  grape leaves (vegetarian but quite good)  and rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor).   Overall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint.   I also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us.   Even homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again.
We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.  Oh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown.
One of my favorite places in town for breakfast.  It's quick (once you're seated). It's greasy (like breakfast from a skillet should be). It's no-nonsense (hash, taters, eggs). It's served with a smile (and usually some awesome conversation). Is it super local? Super sustainable? No. It's a diner.  But a delicious one. And there are planes!
Last night was my first time in The Little Theater which is part of Phoenix Theater.  I didn't see it on the list so I'm reviewing it here.   We saw Reefer Madness the musical!  It was awesome!  I couldn't stop laughing.  The sound of the theater was excellent!   It was definitely small and the seats very uncomfortable.  They had snacks out during intermission.  We bought two water bottles and I was happy to see them put a box out for recycling the water bottles and the soda cans.  They also had a box out for recycling the programs once the play finished.   I will definitely see another play here!
this is place is just horrible. they tried to buy my $380 coach hand purse for $3 dollars ????? are you fudging serious?! the whole store smell so bad, and the second hand clothes they well are way too expensive! DONT SELL THEM YOUR CLOTHES PEOPLE, it's just not worth the trip.
Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's “Italian” restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the “sacra tavola” or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh “off the boats” and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of “La Famiglia” but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local “Eye-talian” businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual “fare la scarpetta”, which means to wipe your plate clean with a piece of bread.  The olives appeared to be sliced black olives from a can.  The linguine was cut so short that it defied twirling on the fork.  I indulged myself with dessert on this special holiday.  As expected, no Sfinge de San Giuseppe, a traditional pastry, on the menu, so I opted for the Tiramisu and a cup of espresso with a splash of Sambuca.   The latter was fine, the former was nothing special.  Perhaps this seems a harsh review.  Many people may like the “Eye-talian” food offered in C-U's restaurants, likely because that is what they are accustomed to.  I like some of the Mexican and Chinese food here but I'm sure that Mexicans and Chinese raised on the authentic cuisine may find it not up to their standards.  So it is with ethnic cuisine.  A lot just depends upon what you are used to.
Really bad & slow service. Will not return.
This review is SOLELY for the flavor Waffle Cone.  Boring.  It has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it.  First, there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it.  It was not a fun and interesting mix of add-ins.    I like their vanilla ice cream, this flavor did nothing for it.
Very reasonably priced and a higher quality pedicure than I expected.  I will be returning.
Jamba Juice and free WiFi.
Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10,000 for $6 at Costco)... but I hate this place.   I break out in hives every time I think about having to go here... So then why do I go here, you may ask. The same reason as everyone else. The same reason listed in all of these glowing reviews... to save a little bit of money.  I come here for almost the same thing every time. Diet Coke, allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast. Those are my three go-to items. Every few months there's the toilet paper, paper towels, laundry detergent... blah, blah, blah. You know the drill.  Why do I hate it so...?   Pretty much for the same reason I have a deep disdain for Walmart. It's chaos. And in true Walmart fashion, I actually saw someone wearing their pajamas here the other day.   People walk around here lulled into some kind of trance by price savings and free samples. It's maddening. In the parking lot, in the store... waiting to turn INTO the parking lot... people are crazy. They completely stop paying attention to what's going on around them. I've been touched inappropriately by shopping carts, nearly run into by cars. It's insanity.   Oh and by the way, speaking of parking lots... why the hell aren't there more cart return areas. I think I've seen two... It's generally a game of, can I find a spot to hide this cart, or should I just walk it to the front of the store.   Another thing: A lot of people talk about the great fuel savings... I've never purchased fuel here. Wanna know why? Because every time I come here, the line for fuel is no less than 3 cars deep per lane! No thanks. I'll pay 10 cents more per gallon somewhere else.   As I sit here typing... anxiety level rising, I wonder to myself... are the savings really worth it? And for now, sadly, the answer is yes. But one day... One Day Costco! I will be free.
Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait, she forgot the taco shells, when she finally got back , she brought pita bread instead, I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland , no seasoning, like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now.
This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden, but had my first experience with this particular one last week. My server was horrific. Being a previous server myself, I can understand the pressures and stress on a busy night. However, this server was completely inattentive and was rushing my friend and I the entire time. Our salads came not even five minutes before our food was sent out. I am completely disappointed. I don't recommend this location to anyone.
Refused to take my cat, which had passed away, for cremation cause I had not been to the clinic previously. IMHO that's ridiculous. I will not recommended anyone to ever come here.
Good hospital. Trauma teams are excellent. There's a reason they filmed a Trauma:Life in the E.R. here. All the nurses on pretty much all the floors are all good. Quite a few gorgeous ones too. Just saying.
I can only comment on carry out.   I have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places.
What's your opinion of an MD who wears a three piece suit?  When I see a doctor wearing a three piece suit, the first thing that comes to my mind is, why is he wearing a suit?  Did he wear a suit to class in med school?  Did he wear a suit doing rounds during residency?  I know lawyers and investment bankers wear suits, but doctors?  I want to see my doctor in  a white coat.   Who wears a suit if they don't have to?  Am I obsessed with what people wear?  Not normally, but when an MD dresses in a suit, then I can't stop wondering why...  You get the picture.  To me, there's something not right about a doctor under the age of seventy wearing a suit.  I could spend this review just commenting about workplace attire, but I need to move on.  Dr Stevens performs surgery at HIS surgery center - YIKES!   I hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice.  They see patients in the office, they do surgery at THEIR surgery center. There's a conflict of interest here:  is it possible that patients who may not need surgery are scheduled for a procedure to pay for all that expensive equipment.  I HATE INCORPORATED DOCTORS!! The Gucci loafers.  The conferences in New York, Anaheim, Orlando, Miami, etc.  Making $200K  from a regular practice isn't enough?  Are you a doctor or a businessman?   What's more important:  helping the sick or your bottom line (like I want a new boat that costs $260,000 and the down payment is $26,000 so I need to get 23 surgeries done in the next 3 weeks to get that payment together).  If I want you to do my surgery at the Mayo Clinic is this possible?   I want to have surgery at a hospital.  Because, let's say something goes wrong.  Drastically wrong, like I stop breathing.  When this happens in a hospital they call code blue and every available doctor and nurse runs as fast as they can and does their best to get you breathing again.  In a surgery center there may not be any other doctors and there may not even be a nurse.  People die in surgery centers.    When I hear surgery center, I think of people getting liposuction and dying from blood loss in the recovery room because the doctor left and no trained medical staff are available.   Dr Stevens is arrogant:   i was extremely ill when I had a consultation with him. I had quite a few questions to ask about my situation.  Dr. Stevens kept writing and wouldn't look me in the eye when he deigned to answer my questions.  He kept looking at his notepad.  Damn it:  stop writing, lift up your head and look at me when I'm talking to you.  While I'm in the middle of this, it began to hit me that this was not the doctor for me.  I'm paying for the consultation, I could barely walk, it was June - so it was HOT outside.  I was exhausted, had been out of work for several weeks.  Was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon. He said he does the procedure i need all the time.  Maybe that was true, but he would NOT be doing this on me. As I was walking to the garage so I could collapse in my car, I was almost ready to give up.  I knew I had to go home, get on the internet and find a doctor that I liked.   I ended up  going with  Dr. Mark Lyons, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic.
I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now, even though the seats are fully occupied It doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine, it is very chinese. And i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant. The sushi is not even firmly made  I am not saying the food is bad, it is actually alright   But they have a great interior and place
A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I'm a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry, we're working on it ... etc. No explanation at all was given. The food was meh. I've had much better. I would not recommend this place to anyone.   As we were walking out a lady was waiting for her takeout order, which she called ahead about. And it wasn't ready yet and she had been waiting over 20 minutes for it. Terrible terrible customer service.
I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.  In the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:  1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.  2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).    EVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.    Another rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.  Before looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!    3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.    So the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.
great local business, servers are very attentive and run around like chickens with their heads cut off they are so busy usually. this is a strange little spot but so good. everything i have had from burgers to seafood was a yummy delight. one of these mornings when im not working im going to go over there and have some breakfast!! :) ive heard great things! my only peeve about the restaurant is that they dont have a to go menu...
Um. It's okay, I guess. They have food at decent prices, but the isles are narrow, everything needs a good cleaning and repainting, and it just felt dark and depressing. Otherwise it's all right, but I don't plan on returning here.
Our last few visits have left something to desire, One of the things I always notice is the demeanor of an establishments employees. These people look miserable, no one smiles or greets you appropriately, it's more like get in, get out, turn the tables,  The food has remained consistently good... when we can order it. the last time JB and I came for a quick dinner, the place was not busy yet we were passed by 6 frowning waitstaff without getting drinks... for 15 minutes we were left suiting at our table with our menus closed and sitting on the edge of the table (HINT, HINT) so we left and most likely will not be returning.
My friend and I stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the AMC theater in the same plaza. Not sure why we picked this place. I think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after we'd already parked and walked in.   Mi Amigo's was never really on my radar as a place to try. I'm more a fan of the hole-in-the-wall “real” mexican food place. This place kinda felt like a mexican-themed, or mexican-inspired restaurant but it lacked something... almost felt like a food court with table service.   The food was fine. It wasn't bad. The service was fine.   My friend had the shrimp and garlic platter, and enjoyed it. I had a small tortilla soup. We probably over-did it with the chips and salsa. And even those were just fine. I would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water (no ice) on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass. No bueno.  No dessert, no drinks. Wasn't really feelin' it.  I wouldn't say I'm jumping at the chance to eat here again. It's serviceable. If I find myself at the AZ Center and other people want to eat here, I will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere, but I won't encourage it. But I won't fight it if the majority rules.
You'll notice a huge age discrepency, really young kids and then there are the adults of all ages.  So I give credz to any insitution that tries to keep kids engaged in using their minds  vs getting their game on in the mall.  I love science museums, making a point to attend in any big city I travel to.  The exhibits seem lacking (even in simple terms) of the magic behind the science... hence probably why the feedback this place is so kids orientated.
Tickets to Phoenix Suns games are cheaper than the large beer in a cup at the arena. $10 tickets and $10.50 brews. I used to watch this arena on TV for years when the Suns were good and I was living elsewhere. It seems less orange in person, maybe some of the seats should be painted orange too. If you know the area, you will know not too pay for parking either. After 5pm, meters are free and obviously on the Sunday I went no charge. Try parking at 5th and monroe street. Inside the arena is pretty nice, I had a great view from the upper deck, but cmon Suns, do you really need ushers kicking people out of upper level seats. Give somebody a tiny bit of power and see what they do with it. Of course, I'm stealthy and uncatchable, so no senior citizen usher is telling me where to sit. Anyway, my team, the Brooklyn Nets won and overall a good, no hassle experience. If the Suns ever get good again, it will be worse to attend. Oh yeah, good entertainment also at least on this day. It was the gorilla's birthday and a ton of mascots were there celebrating and also the trampoline dunkers were cool and the 8 year-old girl who sang the anthem was top notch.
Horrible service. Terrible showroom from 1980. Poor attitude by employee. $17 bucks for two balloons, which the employee self proclaimed he didn't know how to inflate with the helium tank.   Let it fold so another small business can have the spot and contribute to the community.
HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else.
I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.  The menu is, of course, classic Applebee's, something for everyone.  But I found the service to be listless.  When I entered the restaurant the last time, the two hostesses were sitting down; they lifted their eyes to see me, and then reluctantly brought their bodies upright.  One of them greeted me without a smile, and slowly showed me to my seat.  The waiter who took my order only said about two words, and I was supposed to guess what my role was at that moment in the non-conversation.  Zombies have taken over this restaurant.  It's more “Shaun of the Dead” than “My Dinner with Andre.”
I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey, I am not a snob; I love places that save on the little things so they can put it in the food. But sadly this was not the case; it was not the worst Italian I have ever had, I am old enough to remember Wendy's super bar with fettuccine alfredo and hamburger bun bottoms cut in half and slathered in garlic butter. But for the price and the hype it was strike two; I had a Caesar salad and a pasta in cream sauce; both decent portions but nothing to write home about in the end. The service was poor, we did not get the specials but luckily we heard it given to the table beside us (just not lucky enough to have this happen before we ordered). We also ordered bread with our entrees but it never came out. I think my wife summed up our service experience best when she said that at the very least she expected the waiter to pour her can Coke into her plastic cup for her. The bill came and I found myself paying top dollar for mediocre food and poor service; strike three, ball game.
I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!
For all the hype, Michael's is quite a disappointment.   Maybe it's because I didn't try the custard. But seriously, I didn't need more weighing down in this weather...so I ordered an orange crush float instead. For something that would have cost me MAYBE 50cents to make at home, I paid close to $5 for a 12oz cup. That is ridiculous. In general, I think their prices are pretty steep for what you get....you'd probably have to order a burger to really get a bang for your buck...  Like RB, I also had an issue with the service. It was slow, disorganized, and not very friendly. The line was almost out the door, but the employees behind the counter didn't even ATTEMPT to speed up the service. One of them just disappeared into a back room. tsktsk. I also thought it was hilarious how one of the employees crumpled up an order form before the order had been completed, and then had to UNcrumple the paper so she could re-read the order to her coworker. Really?   Anyway, I will probably give the Monroe St. Michael's - and their custards/burgers - a shot, but I'm not going to get my hopes up.
I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right.
My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.    I called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45.   Make sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider.
Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
They forgot a $3 bagel and when I call to inform the manager says it's no problem and to come back in the next day for a replacement. The next day I did that very thing, except the manager was not working and told nobody about the mistake.   So there I am the next day with a skeptical staff of employees thinking I am trying to scam them. They were getting ready to give me the shorted bagel after they asked me 5 questions, but by that time I was embarrassed in front of a crowd of people, which quickly turned into anger and I walked out donating to a company that does not appear to need donations.  There was another indecent a week earlier where I ordered a Bagel Strudel and got some hard stale loaf of something with nuts and berries in it. I ate 1/2 and threw it away and never complained.
I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food, a good beer list and a very chill atmosphere. I typically get the blue cheese burger, while my boyfriend loves to get the London broil sandwich or the pita chicken wrap with honey mustard. The fries and onion rings are delicious too. Plus, it's non-smoking, which I LOVE. I just wish it stayed open later.
I love watching drunk freshman share the plate of Irish Nachos, absolutely hilarious.   Burgers are great, beers good enough for a campus bar. Exactly what you expect.
A friendly place with great seafood.  It is cash only. The clam chowder was meaty and creamy.  The onion rings were crispy and so was the fish. A nice place to see local flair
I am a nice, amicable person. I treat others with kindness and have a highly positive attitude. I rarely complain about things. Thus, it makes me sad to write a negative review. However, the way in which Mozart Management Staff have behaved and conducted themselves over the past two years warrants this review. We moved to Pittsburgh when I was in graduate school. We loved our tiny, cute apartment at Schenley Arms, our first home as a couple. This abruptly changed when simple calls to request that they salt the driveway were met with aggression, irritability and statements such as “we have never had a complaint before” and “we cannot accommodate your schedule”. I felt guilty at first about calling, but then had an epiphany and realized that Mozart has serious issues. The tone of their written  correspondence is also highly intimidating, demeaning and threatening. I will not bore you with the additional myriad of complaints that exist. What ever happened to customer service, decency and basic regard for other human beings?            If you value your hard earned money and do not want to be met with criticism and hostility when interacting with your landlord..AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Also, there are a fair amount of negative reviews when you do a search on Google..READ AND BELIEVE THEM. They are completely mean and disrespectful. This is not the kind of business I want to support, as it conflicts with my value system. We are moving out ASAP when our lease expires.   PS the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve 5 stars! I hope they aren't treated as bad as the tenants.
Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over.   It's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis. But it's still big enough to need a tram of some sort. I've not spotted a tram if there is one here. The moving sidewalks just don't cut it when your connecting flight is already boarding. Many of the moving sidewalks (and there are a lot of them) weren't working, as in out of service. Even an escalator was out of service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to tote a carry on luggage up stairs, I'll inform you that it's not very fun.   The bathroom had an attendant but the bathroom wasn't as clean as many of the other airport bathrooms that I've used. There weren't any toilet seat covers. Some airports even have the rotating plastic seat covers, so nothing at all is very “behind in the time”.   There was a food court and an area that had rocking chairs. That was a first time that I've noticed rocking chairs in an airport. I didn't use them, it was just another observation, plus I was trying to note something positive about this airport.
After two visits to this theater this week, I want to yellp:  turn up the volume! Or seriously look into purchasing new audio equipment, easier said than done, I know. I felt as though I could hear every movement of audience members and the sound of crunching popcorn made me laugh out loud for some reason, but the point is that I was distracted and did not at all feel immersed in the wonderful film in view.
I went to this shop based on the high ratings.  12 days later, 2 loaner cars, $1200, many excuses, a second opinion that found the problem in minutes, and 3 chances later, the issue of new front struts and squeaking and rocking upon braking persist. The car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands. Will go to second opinion Tobias in Cave Creek next time. They seem far more on top of things.
So fun to have a place like this in the Strip.  I just found out that they have chocolate oranges - I look for these in all the stores during Christmas and never thought to come here - well they have white, milk, and dark chocolate varieties available year-round.  I love the dark chocolate, but only because I didn't know the other two kinds existed!  They also have canisters of malted milk balls, unique chocolates from all over, seasonal items, and a cafe-ish area.  I didn't try the hot chocolate, but I hear it's a must-have.  While we walked around the small store, three different salespeople asked if we were finding everything okay - possibly because I kept taking pictures to Instagram and I didn't realize until after I left that there's a sign asking patrons not to take pictures. Ooops!  But no one said anything and they were polite, so thumbs up for the service here.
If I didn't like how close this place was to my house or the giant selection of fabrics I would give it zero stars! The customer service is horrendous!  the people that work there are the rudest people I've ever seen in my entire life at a store. That's all
At the DBG's for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughter's wedding. From the very beginning, Amber that young lady who worked with us was professional, on the ball and organized...far more than I can say about the wedding planner. I believe she must be the park's event coordinator and totally rocked it.   The place is truly beautiful, so different from what a “traditional” garden looks like. Read the other reviews and the other folks will give you a much better idea of the type of plants, bugs, small animals, or as my granddaughter loudly proclaimed “ the birds with the hats!”   There were four other wedding going on the afternoon (4/29/11) but we never really heard much except for some far away music. Signs were clearly posted leading the way to the wedding site *and the rehearsal the night before) and the restrooms were exceptionally clean and pleasant to use.   There was a very large room with shuttered windows and AC where my daughter and her wedding party dressed and a smaller, similar room where the groom and his group readied themselves. After the wedding, as the chairs and such were put away, the entire group came back to the same area which is a small courtyard and had a cocktail hour.   My daughter and her husband were married in the far back arena where they have the outdoor concerts and therein lies the only reason this wonderful place does not get five stars.   If you have your wedding at this particular site, park your car in the dirt lot that is adjacent to the unloading area. It is the first right as you come into the park and has a sign posted that reads “Service area only.” I understand that during the afternoon the park may want you to stroll leisurely through the park enjoying the natural beauty of the place but at the end of a very long day, it would've been so much better to park in back and take a 5 min. walk as opposed to an agonizing 15 min. stroll.  It was incredibly hard for some of the older folks in the group making their way back to the cars and by the time the wedding ended, it was late and the only rangers we saw were on our way out.   It was also very dark there and the lights on the canopy over the wedding table did not come on for a long time but eventually they did and it was truly breathtaking (you may want to have someone be the on the watch for this so the wedding party doesn't eat in the dark.) Lovely place to have a party or wedding, parking not so great.   Thank you DBG for making my daughter's wedding so very memorable!
So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try.   The atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon.   Service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory.   All in all, the trip was worth it, but with the coupon. I would have kicked myself if I had to pay full price for the experience received. That being said, I doubt I will be returning on my own accord.
I drove by this place many times...looking at the all-you-can-eat tue and thur meals.  Well I finally took the bait.  As I entered the place, I was surprised with amount of items on the walls...I thought it was in good taste, but I am sure others will find it tacky.  The food was above average but not the best I have ever had.  The chicken was smokey and moist...the ribs were good, but a few on the dry side.  Waitstaff very nice and attentive.  Great night...I'll be back.
I don't normally come to this laundromat, but the machines in my apartment had been broken for a week and I was getting desparate.  Although parking can be a bit of a pain, I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  There are plenty of washers and dryers to choose from (from regular sized to freakin' 50 pound capacity) and they all seemed to be working great.  It's air-conditioned and clean with vending machines and some old arcade games to spend some more of your quarters on.  My sister and I did four loads of laundry and it cost us about 2.75 per load.  Oh yeah, and they have a change machine that apparently takes 20, 10, 5 and 1 dollar bills.  If I am ever in a pinch again, I will be coming here.
Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER!  We purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed, made an appointment and showed up 10 minutes early only to be informed that they were an hour behind. I even called before I went there to see if maybe there was a cancellation so maybe I cold get in and out earlier. The person who answered the phone, Tasha, didn't say anything about them being behind. Had she said so, I would have waited 45 minutes before going there. Turns out I sat there for almost 3 hours! NOT GOOD! Then when it was time for me to check out, she tried to charge me $3.52  for 'shop materials'. Well, I happen to have worked in a shop and a couple of shop towels doesn't cost $3.52. So I picked up my car keys and left. Next I will be contacting Groupon about this shady business.
Beautiful!! Leisure walk around gorgeous areas. Bring a water bottle. Lots of restrooms about. Lots of shade and resting areas. Beautifully decorated as well! Gorgeous parabolas and fountains and lots of park helpers everywhere! The gift shop is adorable too.
the waitresses are salty. the food is mediocre (at best). the place is a total dump.  however, it's open late, and the cook with the mustache is rad.  also, you meet the funniest people ever there.
Not real impressed.  Sauce wasn't all that and sliced beef was tough. Trash can was full, restaurant wasn't real clean. Two small sandwiches and two sides came to $20.   Won't be back.
This Hooters is near my house so it's always convienient to come here, but the service and the food is hit or miss.  I frequent a lot and really enjoy their wings. The server was MIA all night, twice I had ordered wings one flavor-honey thai and i got the new flavor they have- chipotle honey both times. Was not satisfied at all. Server took my drink for refill and never came back after 20 minutes I asked for the check, she sure was quick to come get that.  The manager there is rude and unattentive, she accused my friend of “making a coupon” that was on their website and did not want to accept it because she said she didn't know where the coupon came from even though we pulled up the website and showed her the coupon.   The one that I really enjoy is the one on Alma School, it is a bit of a drive but the food and service is always spot on!
Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They “fixed” it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the “manager” didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.
The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right?   The decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place.   I ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food.   Yesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am.   I had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad.   I am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...
Met some friends here for a birthday dinner. Place was packed. I was drinking, but the rest of my group enjoyed the cocktails.  Three of us split a mixed grill plate. Had enough for four as opposed to three. We opted for carne asada, carnitas, and chicken. Everything was prepared well and was quite tasty.
They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said “Oh hi, we're showing the apartment”, and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.
Wow, I'm surprised no one has left a review for this place yet. I've been here quite a number of times and I've never been disappointed. Service is good and the food is wonderful. This is the closest thing to getting Chinese food from D.C.  You definitely have to get the general tso's chicken. I drove all the way to get some food from here during last years horrible winter storm. When you have a craving, you have a craving.
I don't care for the lunch buffet because of its limited options (mostly potatoes and beans for vegetarians, sometimes some previously frozen veggie medleys) and lack of spice (for understandable reasons), but for dinner, especially take out, I give Peoples 4 stars.   I usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions!   This restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.
Bottom line: Scott's has a matzo ball soup so good I can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the Jews. Best bagels in Phoenix, hands down. Take your Einstein's and shove it. Scott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. I haven't spent a lot of time in delis in New York, but Scott's reminds me of the “New York deli” I used to live around the corner from in Houston, down the street from the JCC - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. I love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best I've ever had. They have every flavor of Dr Brown's imaginable. The portions are huge - too huge, actually. I'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what I can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that I only go if I know I can take a box home. The service runs hot and cold, but I've never not gotten what I wanted the way I wanted it, and if the waitress isn't looking at me with vague disapproval, I feel like it's not an authentic New York experience.
This place is an embarrassment to mexican restaurants. The food here is terrible! Here's what we ordered: Combo taco/enchilada / oily taco, diarrhea enchilada  Green chilie burrito / the tortilla was plastic and the filling was gross. Taco salad / bunch of stuff with zero taste. Should have grazed in the planter. The beans and rice? Really? They couldn't even get that right. Under cooked bland rice and under cooked beans. This place sux! Beer is good.
This place is really great for teriyaki.  In fact it is really the only place worth going for teriyaki.  First of all - it is really very inexpensive (lunch for two under 20 - easily). Second of all - the service is great because it is family run - you see the same people there everytime.  The food is really good - and just hits the spot when you have a hankering for teriyaki.  My only complaint would be the hours- bums me out when I want teriyaki for dinner and they are already closed.
I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago, this was a regular spot. I remembered the room was dark, food was good, and the infamous pole in the lady's room. So on a recent cold winter night, while Melissa & I were trying to figure out where to eat, knowing this is her regular spot, I said Alexander Michael's!  Parking is always a challenge. Luckily we got a spot down the road off the side street. However the darkness is a little creepy... I feel like I need a buddy system to park there (find a friend, hold hands, and walk together like we were in grade school).  The embiance was perfect for a cold night with the lit candles and closely spaced seatings. We got a table very quickly, but that's as much service as we got that night. There wasn't any incident. The waitress wasn't rude, but she just wasn't there. For a small place like this, it should be pretty easy to take good care of every table.    The food was ok as well. I ordered the london broil sandwich with the soup as side. I forgot the “crab” soup was made with fake crab, which I think should be illegal to be called crab. My sandwich had enough meat on it that I pretty much just ate all the meat, which was average. Tender enough, not too much taste to it.  I guess for $9.50 I couldn't complain. Years later, I felt that their menu was limited, a little overpriced, and seems to be lacking a spark in general with food and service.  I will give it a 2nd chance and visit again, maybe not anytime soon.
Wow. This place is excellent!  I grew up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out.   The meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.  Then there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like...   Our server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard.   Love love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!
I find myself at CherryBlossom a lot nowadays, and that's why I needed to update my review. I've discovered my new favorite menu items, and they must be eaten! So, you should try:  Spicy Gyoza Pot Cha-shu Ramen TanTan-Men Ramen Udon Suki  The gyoza pot is my favorite menu item (and it's on happy hour).  It's simple and delicious. I am completely satisfied with a Kirin and the gyoza pot for dinner. The Cha-shu is a damn good bowl of ramen, and the TanTan is even better if you're up for something spicy. My newest discovery, and the reason I needed to write this, is the Udon Suki. It consists of udon noodles, tofu, green onions, sliced beef, and a poached egg floating in a savory broth. CherryBlossom's Udon Suki is awesome, filling, and awesome.  I have come to the realization that the service is hit or miss at this place, but in my opinion, the food makes up for any shortcomings. Go try some of the dishes I just mentioned and let me know what you think!
o sole mio.. o sole mio...   I forgot what I ate, and I forgot what I drank.. Says a lot about this chain restaurant.  While it does not dissapoint, it is not memorable at all.  The hostess was kinda grumpy. We had an extra person , and she had to move us.. and she was all huff and puff.. I was like, lady, the place is empty.. why you mad?  Anyway, i totally cannot remember what i ate here..
We go here late night around 2 am every night we get out of the club nearby. If it weren't for the fact it's 2 am and we're usually pretty hammered I would never stick around for that long to wait for our food to come out! There's usually a wait (even at 2am) the place is packed. There's always a cop sitting at the bar, haha. It just takes forever to get acknowledged when we walk in, to be sat, to have our order taken, to get our food, to get our bill, etc. It usually takes well over an hour for all of this. Under normal circumstances I would walk out of a place like that. If the servers were all really friendly it might make up for it but some are nice and some look like they'd rather be anywhere but there. Which is understandable I guess but still. I do agree that it is fun to people watch here.
I'm a HUGE fan of the combination bulgogi plate.  Chicken, pork, beef...all on one plate.  I'm getting hungry for some right now.  Too bad I'm two hours away...*sigh*
Terrible service by the sales staff on the floor of the store. I was in a discussion over a item that I was buying for my wife and the sales person allowed a young lady with no apparent manners to interrupt and ask a question that went on to a conversation as if I was no longer there. I could  allow a quick question, but to engage in a ongoing conversation, by the staff associate and the rude customer who interrupted was to much. The sales person should have had the training to be professional and tell the person to wait a moment instead of engaging her as if I did not matter. F$%K this place and the management who allow this type of behavior..Shop elsewhere..
I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived, it was pretty obvious that the Ahi Tuna was old and on its way to being rancid.  I was appalled that any real Chef would ever serve anything that looked that bad.  I was in a business setting where I did not want to make a scene so I ate only the vegetables and did not touch the Tuna for fear of getting sick.  The waitress never ask me if there was anything wrong with my dish even though it should have been obvious to her that I pretty much left the fish untouched.  If you're Uptown, do yourself a favor and go to Halcyon, Mimosa Grille, Ruth Chris or Bernardin before going here for lunch.
Barely OK. Service was flat out terrible. It's always bad when your server throws another server under the bus for taking 5 minutes to get service after sitting down...not impressed. Service throughout the meal was extremely slow and it took 30 minutes to just get our food (for 2 people).   The food is OK. Not even close to the best in Madison. The ribs were very dry and tough. The flavor of the rub was good however. The BBQ sauce on the table was also very good.   Will not be going back.
It's old. Everything was pretty clean, except there was a chocolate smear on the sheet... sketchy. Really, it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate. Breakfast had been cleaned out before 8:30, so get up super early if you want more than white bread and OJ. We might come back if it's still cheap.
Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service. The rooms are not worth the money.
I hate to bemoan the passage of time and the change of ownership ( granted, that's been some time ago); nevertheless, that's exactly where this review is going. My mom is from Germany, and I can remember coming to this place back when the counter staff would speak German with my mom. The had the best liver wurst. It was firm, but not dry, and full of flavor. Now, it's bland and tasteless. I never liked blood sausage, but my mom and two sisters used to adore it. No more. The selection isn't what it was. Commercially, this place seems successful, with lots of restaurants proudly advertising their stuff. But the old faithful have been left bereft.
I stumbled across this museum while on the way to PAM. With a few hours to kill before our flights, my friend and I decided to stop here instead.  It was a great find and I learned so much. Unfortunately I hadn't learned very much about Native American culture or art in school, but I felt like my visit to the Heard made up for that a little. We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names “given” to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, “What are you called?” the people answered, “Pima,” which means “I don't know”--as in, I don't know what you crazy people are asking me!  My friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you're ever in Phoenix.
I've hesitated to write about Fate. I always enjoyed the food and experience at the owner's old Lucky Dragon, even back when it was on University. I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.  We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it.   I'm not really high on the “this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time” style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco.   I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostess/host inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.  The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.  Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- “the food here is terrible... and such small portions!”  I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesame/shrimp/salad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care? We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us.   Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough. Oh, if you're uncomfortable with IKEA furnishings (I'm fine), don't even try it.
I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because “the computer won't let us,” we again got a sub-par breakfast.  So if you want to wakey, wakey, eggs & bac-y, avoid this place.  You will only get eggo waffles and funky tasting food.
Great place to study considering I've spent entire afternoons and evenings there cramming for exams. The staff is really friendly and if you get a ceramic mug refills for coffee are free!
CHIPS and SALSA (2 kinds) and BEAN DIP all while you wait for your food.  Don't bother ordering appetizers, the chips and dips will satisfy you.  If you like margaritas, order the jumbo marg and sit in the nice air conditioned room.  Arriba is Mexican food, nothing fancy with a twist- just good ol' Mexican food.  You know the kind you eat and say “why oh why did I just eat all that?”.  I come here ever so often.  I had the carnitas just recently and was was very happy with my meal.  Have Fun!  Prices range anywhere bettwen $9-$15ish.
Another dismal review for this company. I called for a 6 AM pickup to the airport like I had several times previously. Dispatch informed someone would arrive. I waited until 6:10 AM and called again-dispatch then told me another 15 minutes until pickup! I stated that was not acceptable as I had a flight to catch. I ended up driving myself to the airport. Oh yeah, the driver called, as boarding for my plane started.
I went to an urgent care for a sprained foot. The urgent care provided me an air cast ankle stirrup (even though I sprained my foot!) that sells at Wal Mart for about $47 retail . Hangar Orthotics dba Elite Care billed my insurance $149.00 Insurance paid 74.50 as that was deemed reasonable and customary. I received a bill for the balance which is illegal in AZ where I live. ARS 20-1072. I wonder how many people receive these bills and pay them not knowing? I called up to dispute the amount, and although my call was third I have been waiting 94 minutes with an automated message saying my call is next ... it is now 4:59pm on Friday, I am doubting I will get an answer even though it has been saying my call is next for over an hour. It is too bad YELP does not have a way to give a business ZERO stars I waited until 5:30 and it kept saying I was next. They should have a way of giving NEGATIVE stars
I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head!
So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the  Chinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.   I was soooooo disappointed.  The egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup was served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh.
Dined with a good friend of mine while in town, so the slow(ish) service was no bother. Actually, we had good service. They were on top of my need for water with lots of ice.  Lisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good. The portion was large and she took about half home.  I got the chimichanga. It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the best Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese.   They have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.  I'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was grand and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)
Food is delicious and staff is very prompt.    The one thing I absolutely love about this restaurant is how clean the bathroom is!!!  I was completely stunned and amazed when I walked in.
I like to focus on the positive so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? No  It's a dark bar, my date liked the English vibe of it.  The waitresses were slow (but pleasant) with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked. I ordered a Irish Car Bomb and got less than half a glass of warm Guiness, with the tiniest shot of baileys/whiskey. It was almost undrinkable. Then I ordered the $2.50 drink shot special which tasted like a shot of kool-aid.  We went for the Monday karaoke, and the DJ was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed. I've just been to better karaoke bars (i.e. Ernies)  Like I said my date liked this place, so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par.
Awful just awful, I gave them my car Thursday night at 4, I was informed a part needed ordered they would call me when finished, I called them the following Wednesday confused on why it was taking so long, I was informed it was done Friday and he thought he called me to tell me, I will not be going back, just crap service!!
I have been going to this ranch market for at least eight years. Here is my review. The foods are not the same as they used to be. We bought some tortillas and they usually last about a week, but they started growing mold about three days after.. never used to be this way.  The service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning. The guy at the counter was not very professional and made this face when we asked for eggs, it was like he only wanted us to buy something already made.  When we used to go before they were always more than willing to cook us whatever we needed. On my way back to my table, an employee even walked right into me with no apology!  It used to be so different here.
The cheese counter and “Dear Heart” really are treasures.  They have all manner of fancy aged gruyeres, tons of olives, and even some sort of disgusting concoction called “pepperoni cheese”.  In any case, the place is all kinds of old-world beautiful.  Shelf after shelf of yummy goods, Italian imports...yum.
I've eaten there twice now, and really enjoyed it both times. This IS exceptional because I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine! We ordered our food “family style” both times. Lots of food and lots of fun that way.   We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Carciofi, and the Cheese Ravioli. All were outstanding, especially having been preceded with the Tuscan Salad and “Mama's Salad”. Fanatastico!  Great food and great service. I'll go back again if I'm in downtown Charlotte in the future.
The service was great. Love the martini. The women were so helpful. Cite place!
I went here for their new customer cleaning discount. I made the appointment last week. I showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested. The front doors were locked, no one visible in the office, no response to knocking, no closed sign or “Back at [clock]...”. After pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the office's phone. A person who claimed to work for a 'sister practice' answered, confirmed my appointment, and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office. After several minutes in the rain, he told me that he could only reach an answering machine. I left.  I have never been so grossly disrespected by what's purported to be a business. I have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism. This business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patients'/customers' time. Judging by the other reviews here, I clearly dodged a bullet.
i am a sucker for this place. its not that is soooo fantastic, its that to me when i go to phoenix/scottsdale (to visit my snowmama)  i feel like im kinda in that albert brooks/meryl streep movie that i love where they die and are in some pre-heaven place where they can eat shit all day and never get fat so the portions are huge and obscene. i dont know why retired people get more food than the rest of us,  but the sad reality is that we do get fat when we eat huge amounts of shit.   and while you can still get fat eating at this place (watch out for the choc chip cookies and the entire hot food section), you can be good, and pick the healthy good stuff and go back and feel good about yourself. its hard cause even though that pizza aint that good, after broccoli it aint bad. and again, those choc chip cookies are all over you- i dont really get why they cant leave them at the buffet but have to have some waiter come offer them to you ever 5 seconds. if you have some will power, its pretty good.
ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter “andrew”, which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service.
What I love about Yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the “Nearby” search and prior reviewers telling you, “it's okay, try it!”  The grilled chicken burrito I had was delicious. What makes their burritos is the tortilla!  Their tortillas are the best I've had in a long time. Add the great salsa bar (small but fresh) and you have a great local neighborhood gem.  I would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat, which I love but isn't for everyone.  The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.  Their salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.  Thanks Chico's I'll be back.
Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made, toasted bun, all good! Friendly service.
Locally owned, authentic, good prices, big servings. Gyro meat is moist and full of flavor! Veggies are always fresh. Feta is the best! Go to in the Roosevelt Row neighborhood.
Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.    The blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?  Upon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.  On the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.  I also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).  The drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.    Service on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.  There are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.    I think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?    Pro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!
We order takeout here several times a month. The food is always very good, and quite plentiful for a take-out order. The quality seems pretty consistent as well. They even called me back once to double check something on the order. That was really nice. Delivery times are always good, and they're very fast on slow days. Meals in the restaurant or also high-quality. My wife and I have probably eaten here 40 times in the last five years.
Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd.
I went to this salon on a whim, as I was desperate to get a haircut and color before my scheduled trip. I called on a Friday, and they were able to get me in. I arrived for My appointment on time which was scheduled for 2:15, I didn't get called until 2:40. My stylist Rosie, was nice,  I explained to her what I wanted and we talked about several options on how to get there. Once we agreed on the hair color, I noticed that after she came back from mixing the color, her hands smelled like cigarette smoke. (I can't stand that smell). We talked, and she is very nice. However, I didn't like that she never once checked on me while I was sitting there with the color on my hair, until I started getting a tingling/burn feeling on my scalp.. I asked one of the other stylist if they could call her from the back. My hair looked great but the lightening in the salon isn't that great so I couldn't really see a difference in my shade. Once I got home I noticed that I a had a mess of a hair color. The top part (roots) were alot lighter than the bottom. I called to see if I could reschedule. I got an appointment scheduled for the following day, only for them to call me to tell me she had called in sick. So now I'm off on my scheduled trip looking like a skunk. Unless you are in a hurry or on a serious budget I wouldn't recommend this place.
not the best
I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me, yet some family member drags me there every five years or so.  It never changes. It seems like an independently owned Chili's.  The menu is boring.  The food nothing special.    Most recently, I ordered a salad and asked for some rolls or bread and they didn't have anything except for some super spongy Italian sliced bread that tasted like a step up from wonder bread.  My beet salad had such crunch beets they were barely cooked.  Grapefruit segments were all membrane.  Lettuce was ice cold, nearly frozen.    See you in another five years.
Yelp probably isn't the place you'd look for a dentist, but I'm glad Amy posted a good review because that's what brought me into Dr. Radcliffe's office.  I've never been happier with a dentist.  I like to say that a dentist is only as good as his reception staff, and sometimes a bad front office ruins the best dentist.  Not the case here -- the staff is as awesome as the dentist.  And the office is awesome as well, bright and modern the way it should be.  Dr. Radcliffe is very approachable... extremely nice and quite good at what he does.  He treats you like a member of the family.   It sounds weird to say, but I don't dread going back (and I'm not worried when it's time, because they've always gotten me in whenever I wanted)!
I had a great experience here! Very friendly. Very informative. She made me feel comfortable and able to say what I want my hair to look like. I will definitely go there again! Highly recommend.
Oh jeez I hate it when spring roles around and the drive through starts to smell... If you go to the drive through, be ready to keep your windows up because the grease box in the back STINKS... ugh - going through in a convertible to satisfy my oreo blizzard jones was enough to ruin my appetite.   Service is OK except in two cases, which unfortunately happen often: 1) a crowd of people inside; or 2) some in front at the drive through ordering multiple items.   To be fair, all the ice cream items (why order anything else at DQ?) are fine, as good as any other DQ. But the outside stench at the drive through and slow service limit me to only two stars.
Just a tip...if you're going with kids in the heat, pack bathing suits and towels and hit up one of the splash pads area.
I am a regular here, and not because they do a good job either. I hate this place today. It's very slow so almost no staff. So my car has been setting for 10 minutes now with nobody in line.
Dive bar feel, but possibly one of the best burgers I've had. Made to order and seasoned perfect. The wings are also good.
This place is by far my favorite place to eat. My first time going there my parents took me for my bday! Their eggplant bites and corn cakes are thee best appetizers. Their bread pudding is thee best sweet thing I've ever put in my mouth! Thumbs up to this place!!
Best place to go, uptown, for all of your eye care needs. Great docs and staff.  Highly recommend.
The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine, I understand it happens sometimes. However while waiting two hours, we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner. We got the same response every time. “It'll be right up.” He did not consider actually checking on the food. All the tables around us came, ate and left. Meanwhile, our server could not even remember to bring water to the table without being asked multiple times.   After I stopped asking nicely about our food, the server finally went to inquire. The manager offered to comp two beers for waiting two hours if we wanted to just  leave. How generous. Otherwise she offered to discount our meals and offered us what we thought was another round of beers. She did not even follow through on that promise. We were given one free beer each. Pathetic. Over 80% of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention. People who make it a point to dine here every time we come.   The server never apologized. Nor did he bother to even clear our plates.  There are plenty of other places to spend your money where it will be appreciated.
When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.  My main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).  I call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.  Overall, here is how I feel:  +Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown -Poor customer service -Poor user experience -Overpriced  If you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them.
This place is huge, and that is good because it can get packed pretty quickly on the weekends. This is especially true when the weather outside forces us to look for indoor activities.   Unlike the previous poster, I initially had a hard time figuring out the computer seated at the table. I kept jamming my fat little fingers onto the screen expecting a touch screen response. Fortunately the other bowlers in my party realized that my genius was showing and helped me figure it out. Durrrrrr.   The bowling was fun, even though I probably should have had the bumpers on like the minors in our group did. At least then I would have not looked liked the biggest dork in three counties, just a weeny.   We ordered deep fried cheese curds, and deep fried macaroni for snacking. No healthy eating here!!! They were yummy, and just as good as Culver's. But since I've said that, now I'll have to hide from rabid Culver's fans. Yikes!   We'll go here again, and I can once again provide comic relief with my mad bowling skillz.   Werd.
I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.  I have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.
So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 “Chinese” pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my “Chinese” pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out!
My wife and I didn't have the best of Labor Day week ends. First her car over heats Saturday night and we have drop it off at a garage for repair. She borrows my car which decides to shred its back tire Sunday night during a raging thunderstorm and no one open to fix it because its a holiday week end,so we are now without a vehicle. My wife reserves a car on line and no where on the website does it say you have to have a major credit card to rent car. Our daughter picks us up and we drive 45 minutes to the airport and wait in line only to be told when we present our debit card that we need a major credit card to rent a car. WTF!! A debit card is the same as cash and we are being turned down for a car rental??? My wife informed the clerk that she had used this same debit card in other cities to rent car while she was on business trips and at this point he takes a condescending attitude and told us we were not renting a car with a debit card. I kept my cool until the clerk starting waving my wife's debit card in our face and treating us like we were white trash because we did not have a credit card. At this point both my wife and I lost it and I profanely told him what I thought of him and Enterprise care rental. My wife snatched her debit card out of his hand and we stormed out mad as hell. My wife and I do not have nor care to have a major credit card. If we can not pay cash for something, we do not buy it. I cannot believe in todays world a company will not take a debit card for a purchase. If Enterprise was the last car rental place on the face of the earth and we don't have a car, we will walk rather than rent from them!
This hotel is in need of a renovation. This becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms, which have fixtures and mildew growth both from the seventies. I've stayed in motels that were cleaner and better appointed.  I could have done without the Sleep Number bed, but that's probably more of a personal preference than anything. However, it appeared to me that the money would have been better spent on updating the rooms themselves. Apparently it used to be a Marriott some time ago - I'm guessing they decided to drop the brand rather than update to Marriott's standards.  The continental breakfast was a crime. $12 for buffet style eggs (from a bag no less), sausage, french toast, and oily potato cubes they were trying to say were home fries is unconscionable. Passing on this gastronomic atrocity, I decided to invest my money in an english muffin and two 4 oz. yogurts (only option is Strawberry Banana? Really?).  At least there was a pretty nice pool where we could... oh, closed for private party. Just as well.  Thankfully this was a business trip and the client is paying expenses, otherwise I might have actually felt upset.
The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far.
Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water, when I sent it back she said they just changed it.  Came back and said we don't have coke, would you like a sprite.  The sprite was flat but I was afraid to order a water after that.  Why didn't we just leave then.  The menu had quite a few spelling errors we joked about but no joke - don't go here.  If I could rate this a zero, I would.
Well I went to school here and loved it and I feel like I got a great education. It may be huge but once you find your niche you will do just fine! You just have to make sure you go to class and take good notes because most classes are so huge they won't harass you to come, yet just expect you to! I loved the Big Ten games and the energy of the campus. I would never have picked a different place to spend four years!
I don't get what people like about this place. It's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress. I've tried at least twice -- maybe I'm ordering wrong but I really just don't get it...
It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't good.   As soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this “Pittsburgh” experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed.   After being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.  The sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards.   If you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the “Pittsburgh” experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return.
My wife and I came in last week to get ourselves a new mattress.  Our salesman, Antwan, was interested in helping us get the right bed, not the most expensive one.  We ended up purchasing one, had it delivered and put into place the next day.  Been sleeping great since then.  Recommend checking them out when your in the market for a new mattress.
Yesterday, we stop in for a late lunch. We decide to split a couple appetizers. While we are waiting they brought us the normal chips and salsa. The chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too. Then our food came. We ordered loaded nachos - which were far from loaded. I am still trying to figure out how they managed to put everything in one tiny corner of the plate. The second plate was the mini chimis. Oh my gosh, they were even worse! Soggy, covered in sour cream and what I think was guacamole?  They were inedible! Yuck! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. No no no
I recently frequented Wild Thaiger on a whim... based mostly on other Yelp reviews and convenience of location. I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  Although the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff.  The menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in “ethnic” cooking.  The vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items.  I didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that.  All in all, a great experience.
I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews, I thought “Eh, what the hell.”  We came in and were seated at 5:45pm for desserts/drinks.   By 6:05, we still hadn't seen our waitress.  We decided it wasn't worth it and just left.  I did eat here a month ago, and yes -- the fried fish was fried to the point where it was beyond greasy.  And then to pay around $20 for that?  LOL.  Right.  I won't be back.
While I am not much on chain restaurants, Rock Bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again.    My boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover.  Rock Bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool.  The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).  The menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.    The gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.  We were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to Rock Bottom and had friends meet us there.    Good food, great service, great drinks...we will definitely be back.
The lobster bisque is amazing I do agree, however anything above and beyond the bar takes acts of congress to get right.. the server took it upon himself to assume I wanted a side portion instead of a dinner portion of a salad at dinner time (weird). It takes forever to get another beer, heaven forbid your thirsty on a bad day.... lastly by the time my husband was able to grab the attention of Said server for katsup and mustard his burger it was cold and my salad had yet to arrive.. hence the extra time to sip on my late beer waiting for dinner.. I would say there are better more collected establishments in the area... wait as I hear the second ring from the kitchen for the salad that I can see from the window but can not have... :(
Waited over an hour to be seated just to see people who got here after us get a table...yeah the girl crossed us off the list for no reason. Noobs at the bar left us waiting to pay for the drinks we got while we were waiting, and then when we finally get seated guess what, it's another hour wait for our pizza.... Could have told us that before the first hour!!! Save yourself the 2 hours of waiting and go to Pizza Hut, you'll be much less dissatisfied. I would give this place zero stars if I could.
This is a great bar if you have kids.... I know that sounds weird but listen. They have a beach  and tiki bar in the rear with cornhole, beer pong, ping pong, horseshoes etc.... They have a stage out there for live music. Big portions of food for not alot of cash. Becoming a Friday night tradition
This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.  I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it).
I seem to always get up sold whenever I go to an Autobell. The problem is, I spend more money thinking I will get better service but it is never the case with autobell. This location was no different. Stick with the normal cleaning packages and it is well worth the money. Buy their upgrades and it is a waste.
Here's the lowdown:  They're like every other shop that makes you take it in the Chili Ring. They only did the bare minimum amount of work possible to align my vehicle. I know a lot about alignment, I would have done it myself if I had access to the equipment. They only adjusted the Toe-in, and reported back that the bolt which actuates the upper control arm eccentric was frozen so they couldn't make the adjustment to the caster angle.   I then informed Jr. Pinhead that I have a Benzo-matic torch and can heat the bolt to loosen it, which he replied that his tech had use a torch on all the bolts. Funny thing is in the report from the equipment, all the angles were within spec that would have required heat to loosen the adjustment hardware, with the exception of the 'frozen' one.  I used to work at a Firestone and I thought that lazy shit was just at my location. I was expecting this type of work from a local shop with a couple of random dopers.... not Firestone
We recently went to Clyde's Hardware for a replacement part for a bidet.  Salesman was helpful but had to order the part which he did on the computer or so we thought.  Told us the part was in stock, took our credit card payment and told us a day when the part would be there.  But they NEVER ordered the part!!  When I inquired, Debbie was curt to say the least.  Later called me and told me the part “was on back order!”  Not so according to the salesman.  Why oh why would we want to do business with them in the future?  We were required to pay shipping ($13.00 for a plastic part that weighed no more than 1/2 ounce) plus tax, plus made several trips to the store and to be treated like that??  No wonder amazon and other competitors are cleaning their clocks and they have a sign on their door not allowing photos.
I made an appointment because I had an terrible, stabbing ear ache. After waiting nearly an hour after my appointment time, I was quickly ushered into a tiny room and without being asked anything, I was given a hearing test. I never asked for it and don't know why it was done. Then after another long waiting period, the doctor finally saw me and he tells me I have hearing loss. He looks into my aching ear and bluntly tells me I have no infection but rather TMJ which really, really scared me. I think he was wrong because two days later I had infected bumps on the side of my face and after it cleared, no more pain. The entire visit was a horrible waste of time which didn't help me at all and took nearly three hours!
have not been there in a long time...the guy taking the order was in some other world. the amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half. the drinks are watered down. and the prices are up. Me thinks I wont be back there.
Great place to watch a game, and banging wings!  What else could you want.
Avoid this place at all costs.  Horrifically uncomfortable mattress?  Check. Paper thin walls and a creaky floor/ceiling that sounds like others are IN your room?  Check.  Gangs if bikers partying outside your door and yet miraculously - and loudly - coming to blows in the morning?  Check.  By all that is holy, do NOT stay here.    I would give 0 stars if allowed...
Service 5 stars, food 2 stars, atmosphere 2 stars. Overall 2.5 stars.
This is my favorite place in charlotte, with my grandmothers nursing home across the street and me traveling all the time on an fixed amount to spend per city it's great too just sit by the pond and people watch.
I took my phone out while walking around. “No photography in the store, hun,” to which I replied that I was not. “I know, sweetheart, I'm just sayin', there's no photography in the store, honey.”   It's hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff. Being called pet names by strange women does not help.   I contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable.   This is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review. The general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior.  That really makes up for it. My greatest fear was that it was a given that if you're a woman in Autozone you're going to encounter condescending employees. I really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case.  Thanks for caring, AutoZone!
Must have been an off day last time. These partners are phenomenal!
On Yelp, a 500th review is a milestone.  It's a big deal and for those of us that have written hundreds of reviews, it's a place to talk about a business that has had an impact on our lives  Fairpoint Communications is such a business.  Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver.  In a nutshell, it has been a disaster.  Fairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up.  They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth.  One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service.  When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly.  The billing was never correct.  The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day.  Calls about all of these issues rarely went well.  People were apologetic but problems remained.  Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers.  Two different people in my office were reduced to tears.  Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles..  My company switched carriers recently.  Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened.  Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly.  To Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew.  Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care.  I hope you are fined out of existence.  To New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do.  I should review you separately.  I don't generally give out one-star reviews.  This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review.  I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.
My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.
I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such “games”, you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.
Over Rated and to crowded.  Go to Mi Patio or La Canasta instead.  Or, go a little further north to Via Delosantos for even better food and drinks!
Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.
Why would anyone pay money for food like this?
I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.  Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.  They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.  They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.  If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one.
I wish this place were better! The only redeeming factor about this place is the happy hour. I went here yesterday just after the lunch hour and the service and food were both below average. Don't get me wrong, the hostesses were nice... when they were actually around.  I had the veggie burger and my friend had the beef brisket with bourbon sauce. Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible. My veggie burger had a terrible mush consistency and the quality of the bun was awful. My friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless.   For the price I would expect better food... much better food.   Honestly, they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps. Quit the food, up the drinks.
Umi is alright.  What I mean by this is that the food is high quality, and the service is high quality, but for some reason, I'm never completely satisfied when I leave.  Let's start with the good:  They have great quality sushi.  They have interesting taste combinations.  The decor is fun, especially if you sit in the “traditional” seating area where you don't actually sit on the floor (if you can ever manage to get in and out of this seating in a graceful manner, kudos to you).    But, the portions are small, and every time we've eaten here, we come away with the sense of, “great meal, but holy moly.  Dunno if it was $XXX good.”  We'll continue to come, but probably only if someone else is paying.  In the meantime, it's off to Tamari we go.
What a lousy experience.  Perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular Hertz Gold customer I was astonished at the disorganization of this facility. Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers, many Gold got off the bus to find their name not on the Gold sign, so more than  half a dozen of us lined up outside (gold office too small for more than 3-4 people) to wait for ONE person to find us cars.  Finally after 20 mins a second person came to help  After a significant wait I was asked if I really needed a full-sized car as requested.  Since it was apparent something else would be quicker I took what they offered (of course smaller not more luxurious). The car was fine - however, the return experience on Friday afternoon was just as miserable - perhaps more so since I was now running late for my flight.   First of all, CLT airport you need a traffic light at the intersection Near the  Hertz return entrance - it took about 15 mins to get across the street -thankfully and airport official car coincidentally came by and let cars that needed to go straight into the lot cross.   And then, we waited another 15 mins for a bus to take us to the terminal - bad planning Hertz. If I didn't have TSA per-check Or had to check a bag, I'm not sure I would have made my flight.   Totally unacceptable service - that's an oxymoron with Hertz Charlotte.
Good bread, but steakums do not a cheesesteak make. Stick with cold subs.
What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new favorite restaurant. We don't eat out much but when it comes to sushi we definitely are picky.   We showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal with just the right amount of everything. But not really being in a sushi mood we didn't give any of their amazing sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. The vegetables and meat were cooked great and the taste was just right. My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed with this place and will definitely be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time.
Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that's about it.
Maybe the most disorganized store I have ever seen. Now, add that in with trying to bring my dog with me into this store...Pure Chaos.   My last visit (of many I've made to this PetSmart) made me realize that I'm better off heading to either Fleet Farm or Tabby and Jacks to get whatever I may be looking at locally for my dog.    I enjoy the fact I can walk my dog into the store to get what I need, but when I head to the footwear isle to find nothing for medium to large dog sizes I get a little irritated.  Do the employee's working here know how to stock the shelves? Why are all the socks and footwear thrown all over the bottom shelf of the clothing isle?   Not everyone has a 10 lb dog. I'm not even asking much. I have a 48 lb English Bulldog and I still could not find anything in his size.   The last thing I want to do is sift through items thrown all over the floor and shelf. Forget it!   I asked a employee if they carried socks for medium to large size dogs  (their website says this store does have these items in stock) and instead of even helping me sift through their ridiculous isle I was told, “What you see if what we have”.  Come on Man!!!!! Really? Is this your best customer service?  Not sure If you will be seeing much more of me and my Bully anytime soon coming back in here.
Mediocre, unsatisfying and barely average!  I joined a friend recently on a Friday night and the entire meal was barely passable. The calamari was uninspired and bland, just sauteed with a thin red sauce and a few frozen peas. Hardly inspiring. The 4 bruschetta were good, with interesting touches like honey and chicken liver, but another tasted like it had plain old strawberry jam on top of mascarpone cheese?  The fettucini carbonara was exceptionally bland and lacked the classic ingredients in abundance like it should including peas. Did they end up in the calamari by mistake ?    The house recommended fresh tagliatelle with bolognese sauce was sad and uninspired and poorly prepared and presented. Really, as a Chef, I found the dish lacking any depth, including the unseasoned meat sauce (6 different meats in the sauce according to the owner, but still lacking any depth, flavor or significant interest). The sauce was mixed into the noodles already and looked very amateurish and very cafeteria-like. A real disappointment overall.     The prices are actually a bit expensive for a strip mall and poor quality. Plastic cups for water, paper napkins for dinner service and piccolo pours of a limited wine selection only added to the lack of value.   Will definitely not return. A disappointing experience that needs attention and correction.
The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.
This is a great  stop for a meal if your going to a Bobcat's game or any event at Time Warner arena. They have covered garage parking for just $5 and a menu that just won't quit. They've got something for everyone. Try the Mahi tacos, two fresh and flavorful,  crispy tacos, covered with a soft flour tortilla...the flavor screams at you...! If it's busy, you can get a game of pool on the two billiard tables or sit at the bar and enjoy on of the many big screen plasmas.  It's a five mimute walk to the Bobcat's and the Blue Line Lynx with easy access stop to Panthers.
Picture Billy Joel's “Piano Man” DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.  If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.  The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?  Dueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!
These guys rip you off. I had a coupon for an oil change, fluid top off, and a tire rotation.  I have a scratched rim on my car so I know where it was they said they rotated my tires when in fact they didn't. Total losers
I wish I had read the previous review first.  My boyfriend and I were craving a Cajun Chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home.  The chicken was so dry, hard and overcooked it was like chicken jerky & didn't even taste anything like it should.  We were so disappointed so he called to tell the manager and she didn't offer us a better one or anything free next time.  It was just a waste of $10 because we couldn't eat it.  They probably won't get my business again!
For my 500th review, I thought about writing about beaches in San Diego, art centers in Los Angeles, cafes in New Mexico, or bookstores in Boston.  But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.    I moved a month ago to Chambana, and it has quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.  Enter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.  There's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.    If I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts. :)  The website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system. :)  In short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time.
Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews, and I would say what others have said is pretty accurate. It is very authentic, looks like a total dive from the outside, and it's in a Hispanic neighborhood. But, the tacos here are great! Now, just to be clear, these are street style tacos, they are small, but they are only $0.99/each, which seems pretty reasonable.   I ordered an adobada, al pastor, carnitas, and a shredded beef with red chiles. Each were very good in their own unique ways, the meat was good quality and everything had the appropriate amounts of seasoning and flavor. The adobada was the standout in my mouth, so much that I had to go back and order another one! I also had a side of rice and beans, which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.   So far so good, right? The only slip up this place maybe has, is that my girlfriend, that was with me, who doesn't eat meat, was not overly impressed. She got a bean and cheese burrito and a shrimp taco. The shrimp taco looked good, and she said everything tasted alright, but she was not wowed, like I was, about the quality of the tacos. She did enjoy the beans and rice though. So, this place might not be the best veg friendly location, but I'm not really going to take off for that, because it is very authentic, and veg friendly isn't necessarily what they are trying to do. They are trying to make good, traditional tacos, and that they do that very well.   They also serve beer here, and I love the way it's served. Your bottle or can is brought out with a mug that is frosted, salted, and has lime juice in the bottom. Speaking of bringing you the glass, the service is wonderful. Our server was very friendly, patient, nice and helpful.   All in all, if you are looking for a good taco shop, nothing fancy, and authentic, this might be your best bet. Or at least it is from the places I have been so far...
Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes.
A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.     I had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.
We go there for most of our fresh foods, it doesn't have the feel of a neighborhood grocer but the quality and selection are terrific.
This brueggs kinda sucks. Every time I've come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isn't doing their counts correctly (use to work at a brueggers). The service is lousy. Also apparently brueggers discontinued sprouts-not this stores fault but wtf?! Sprouts are awesome. Going to Poppy's next time.
At my first visit this month, Dr. Radke and her assistants were wonderful. I never had to wait long and most importantly, Radke really addressed my eye allergies (a new phenomenon for me as a recent Wisco resident) and pointed me toward some new contacts that are AMAZINGLY COMFORTABLE!  I really like that they offer Optomap as an alternative to dilating your eyes. It isn't covered under insurance but the cost is well worth avoiding dilation eye drops in my book.
The single most disgusting sushi experience I've ever had. Asian nachos were burned and tasteless, April and Toosties rolls were totally bland and the texture was way off, the crab wontons came with some funky nasty sauce.. Blahhhh. $50 down the toilet.
This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS, my gal from China Express (now closed, was downtown) cooks there, so I had to make it happen.  This place is simple.  It has chicken on a stick, mung bean pancakes, & I think some sort of spring roll.  The only thing I've ever tried is the chicken on a stick, and really, it's all I need.  these little thingers are delicious, and they're only $3.    They have two different sauces to dump on it, and I get it with both; one is some sort of Korean BBQ sauce & the other is just Sriracha.  Then it's wrapped in foil, and handed off.  Make sure you get extra napkins, as they're messy.  Any time I run to the strip to get a few staples, I inevitably swing through and get a chicken on a stick.  You should too...you won't regret it.
Unos has been around for ever, & I feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80's. Honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.  If you haven't died and he recently I ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!  They have the best chicken salad wrap ever! I love that rap so much I want agreed to walk the south side River Trail from where the Steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because I knew that I could convince my boyfriend to go to Unos with me for lunch.  Full disclosure:  I made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.  Listen... The food and pizza and service are very good, surprisingly so! I don't know why this place is not busier but next time you're down at the Waterfront please do consider dining here!
Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch, it needs to not only be good, but also unique. Unfortunately, Pamela's is neither of these things. Then again, the hour-long wait does provide you will ample time to find a ATM because they only take cash. If you want to wait in line for an hour for food that is both good and unique, try Coca Cafe.
I live on the east side of Madison and I always eat at the Imperial Gardens near E. Washington and this Imperial was a let down. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely but the food and staff wasn't as amazing as I hoped for.   For starters, the food is so expensive compared to the east side and the plates are larger but the portions are definitely not bigger. Our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down. My friend loves oyster beef but what received tasted completely different and it had a weird sort of sour after taste. I had the pepper steak and I did like how the onions and peppers are more thinly sliced but my meat also had a strange after taste.  The staff was very kind but a little annoying. It's was great at first to see how attentive they were to our needs but the waitress came to us almost every 10min and made awkward small talk which really bothered us. We could then see her staring at us from across the room waiting to start another unwanted conversation.  Imperial Garden Middleton will definitely be memorable but, for all the wrong reasons.
The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again.
Crust takes almost exactly like cardboard and the toppings are icky.  I can't imagine why anyone would order from here.  Although I did make a second order from here one time - New Year's Eve in fact - but that was only because the cab we had booked never showed up to bring us back home from downtown.  So, I walked here, ordered a pizza to be delivered to my house, then tried to make the delivery guy drive me AND the pizza.  Pretty smart, huh?  Too bad they wouldn't let me though.  So I canceled the ordered and kept on walking.  And walking.  And walking.  It's a long way to east Urbana from downtown Champaign.  In the cold.  On New Year's Eve.
I've left a review before saying that I love this place and they have great service!  Boy did my waiter prove me wrong today!! We had the worst service ever! He was rude and never came to ask how we were doing or if we needed anything! He kept passing by but would never come to our table. I was so disappointed!
My wife (who is from Phoenix and spent countless meals at this restaurant) characterized this place to me as the “Gay Denny's”--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.  After seeing about a dozen or more references to “Jenny's”, I realized that my wife's characterization is not only accurate, but quite routine and popular.  Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under “Diners, Gay Bars”.  That speaks volumes of coolness.  There is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.  Food was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.  Recommended.
Found  hair in my food.  BLECH!!  Never ever again!
We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example, our server brought our ticket to the table. 15 minutes later, she ambled by to pick up the ticket with our credit card. 10 minutes later, she finally brought it back for me to sign. This was after an hour-and-a-half dining experience which should have taken half the time but due to our waitress' slowness and lack of attention, was stretched into painful wait times. Never received a refill on my soda. This was not during prime time, either - we arrived around 4:30PM on Saturday.  As far as the food went, it was good - I had the Admiral's Feast, which I took half of home because it was so much. My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up.  I just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there.  As far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.
Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.  Food is just okay, not great.  Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much.
I really want to love this place, but I can't. The fries are great, the servers attractive and the food gets there fast, but the entrees aren't that great, bottle beer is $4 (that much for a miller lite at a sports bar? really?) and the servers, for whatever stupid, dumbass reason, refuse to split checks.  This does nothing but piss me off. I've never understood this practice. First of all, you're a sports bar. People genuinely come into sports bars in groups. We all ordered food, we all ordered drinks and it took nearly 25 minutes to figure out our goddamn bill at the end.  Attention restaurant owners: MOST OF US DON'T CARRY CASH ANYMORE. Get with it and start splitting checks or train your servers to do that with large groups. There is no reason to make things more difficult for customers and servers will get better tips.
Excellent food with great service.
A different style (love or hate) pizza. A square cut thicker crust with cold shredded cheese on top. It's different enough that it is a good chance of pace to your standard pie.
Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?  A few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.  The fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.    I'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.
Man, this place is packed with moms, dads, and their UIUC-enrolled kids.  I swear, they used this location to film their latest commercial, about a college girl, her parents, and her (freeloading) roommates/friends.  Sometimes you gotta fill a craving, and that means waiting an hour for a table.  And all Conan O'Brien/Jim Cramer jokes* aside, it's a pretty damn good place to go for the money. And the chairs have wheels! WEEEEEE!  I swear, the soup/salad/breadsticks have sprinkles of crack and MSG, they're pretty addicting.  And I'm pretty sure they use one can of Morton's salt per serving bowl of salad.  Tip: Make sure you ask for more salad and breadsticks as soon as you get your first batch, or the waiter will disappear until your entrees arrive.  By then, they know they got you pinned against a psychological wall, because who eats more salad with their entree?  Break past that wall of uncomfortability and continue to ask for refills until the check arrives.  Heck, ask for it after the check arrives.  It's like a glass of water - it should always be full.  FYI, the sangria is f-ing expensive. BEWARE!  *If you haven't seen Conan's impression of an Italian grandfather going to Olive Garden or the Conan/Cramer interview about Olive Garden, do so immediately.
Be prepared to wait. We were told to be here at 11:15 for an 11:40 appointment. Coming up on an hour wait, ugh! After waiting over an hour to see the doctor, and to only talk to him for 5 minutes, was very disappointing.  The appointment was for my Mother who was previously told she could undergo a specific eye surgery and then upon arriving and pre-op review, she was not qualified. Not only was the experience in this office disappointing, it was a disappointing day for my Mother after expectations were expected.
A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this. There is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it. The art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then.
Worst Best Buy ever.  I just had an employee there throw a temper tandrum because I asked him to call someone who has keys to the mobile locker over so I can buy my item.  Treating customers like crap just because someone asks if they can buy something?  Methinks not.  Never again.  NEVER again.
My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.  The atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.  Our waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.  Following the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.  I'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food.
I did not use his service because he told me that the corrections that I needed in my clothes would not look good after.  He could have just done it and take the money, but he preferred to advise me and not do the work. Definitely will be back when I need something to be done.
Here's the thing... shortly after being seated the waitress spilled an entire pint glass of water DIRECTLY in my lap.  She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment.
Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember
Came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building. No host/ess, no wandering servers, no customers... We had to search the place for someone to seat us and the first people we ran into were a couple of off-duty servers who were rolling silverware. The male kindly sat us and got our drinks for us. It took a ridiculously long time for our server to even appear at our table and just as long for our food to come out. To make everything worse, the only other couple in the restaurant who were sitting behind us were complaining to the server about their food. The server returned to their table a bit later (no manager) and said that “the manager” told him that since the food is made early in the day, it can lose texture and flavor by the time it is served. WHAT? Seriously???? It was hard to enjoy our food at all by the time it arrived.  The food left much the be desired. The service was the worst I've ever encountered. I don't usually leave complaints on restaurant websites but I had to leave one for this terrible visit. They gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. Needless to say we did not return to redeem it.
I just love going here!  You can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have!    So normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine.  Or I grab some sake, which I absolutely love and can't find anywhere else.  It's at this point when I hit up their deli for a delicious tuna salad sandwich.  It's so disgustingly good, it's sinful!  The people that work there are so nice and helpful!  All in all, just a great experience!
Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.  My wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.  After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked.  Luckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with “ where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.”  If i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.  Getting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.  I think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less. Four star 4 diamond yea right.
Really good service.  James at the bar made some really good recommendations. The place is right next to Pizzeria Bianco.  So while you wait for a table there, come here for a drink and kick it.  They also have a great wine menu, if you're into that.  I guess on Fridays they have a live band playing inside.
Love the food, quality, and cleanliness. The staff Jimmy and Austin were both friendly and helpful and customer oriented. The few times I've been in though the female servers were standing around chatting about their personal things loudly and not tending to tables as quickly as they should, that is what kept me from giving a five star. Otherwise, awesome place to eat.
The reason for this update is the service.  The hotel itself is still beautiful and the food is above average.  All solid four stars.  I was a bit disappointed initially with some of the pre-arrangements.  In the past I was able to have a complimentary room and the fee waived for the coat check girl.  Friday night because the party was a bit smaller than the last they only discounted the room and charged full fee for coat check/ carving station/ etc.  Now, with that being said the service was over the top 5+++ stars from start to finish.  I get there and am running a bit late. I ask the bellboy Eric how long for a shoe shine, he states its pretty much an overnight service.  I tell him I'm in a rush.  He runs downstairs and shines them himself, done in 30 minutes.  While I'm waiting my contact for the night Ryan Hunt sends up a cheese dish with a bottle of above average wine.  The party goes off without a hitch, great staff, good food, some discounted wines and good premium open bar.  After the hotel party we are walking outside and run into Eric (bellboy) again ask for directions to other club, instead of giving them to us he walks us to the club.  One of the girls wanted cigarettes and instead of directing her to the store.  He ran down and bought them for her and brought them back.  Btw, did I mention he was done working for the night and just did this off the clock.  The next morning I get a ring around 11 am in the hotel room and its the bellboy bringing up aspirin and bottled water from a long night prior.  Everything about this place is three to four stars.  My main pet peeves are the valet cost ($17 and $25 overnight).  There lack of flexibility in food/bev minimums, but the service is over the top great or at least my contacts were over the top great with service.  You can't go wrong in Pittsburgh for an event at this spot.
Great tailoring hands down. I've had jeans taken in, dresses altered and hems taken up - all perfectly done. I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress. While I personally think it's worth it for expert tailoring, others may think it's a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring.   Also, the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked. You can trust your nicest pieces here - they are in good hands!
More like Downstream. In town from CA and wanted to try something new. Bad decision. Bad service. Food was bland & ill prepared. What a disappointment.
20% discount with AAA card :)
****** 4.5 stars *****  One of the few places where I can safely say that anything you order from the menu will be sure to please. Mimosa is one of downtown Charlotte's original “great” restaurants, there long before all the big chain steakhouses decided to take up residence. This place is as safe as it gets, and doesn't break the bank doing it. The decor is very fashionable, and presents a really nice atmosphere without feeling too white tablecloth-like.  I really like the “upscale Southern” idea, and not many places in the country can pull it off as well or as consistently as Mimosa does. They specialize in local produce and meats, doing a great job of supporting all the great foods natural to NC. Any time one of my favorite dishes in a restaurant is a beefsteak salad you know they focus on all the details, because it takes a LOT more than you would think to make a REALLY good salad.  Whether you're a Charlotte native, or just visiting the city for business, Mimosa should definitely be on your list of places to try if you want a real taste of Charlotte. It may be easy to go with the big chains like Mortons, Capital Grill, and Ruth's Chris, but your money will be much better spent and go a lot further here!
Really need shorter waiting lines- it got worse.  The valet is annoying and gets in the way.
Tessaros has a full menu, but if you go there you need, no you must order a burger.   They have the very best restaurant burgers I have ever eaten.   Not greasy, great taste, and they grill them right there in the bar.  Don't miss out on the best burger of your life.
Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed.   The service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all.   The eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate.   Overall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning.
What can I say about Comedor that hasn't already been said... The food is reasonably priced and the selection is huge. Back in the day before I started telecommuting, a margarita or beer paired with one of their daily specials have gotten me through more than one long assed afternoon at work (please don't tell my boss).  The wait staff is incredibly nice and watching newbies squint under the bright lights and bad south of the boarder art is always entertaining.  If you want to be a little bold, try one of their soups. They are scarrier than shit if you are a white girl that grew up on meat and potatoes, but they taste great (I just don't ask whats in it). LOL
I have had terrible luck with this lawn service recently. Please do not furnish Sergio with your credit card number; he will put the card through on PayPal, which is very hard to stop when he is processing fraudulent charges. His crew stole a valuable tree-lopping tool from me at a house I was leasing right before I moved out. Then, after I moved out, he has billed me for monthly services for two months running because, despite being informed by me on the phone, he claims that I have to terminate his services in writing.  This is the worst consumer experience I have had in years and I feel that this behavior has to be stopped. I'm certain most people don't count obtaining a new credit card and taking a trip to small claims court as among the experiences they are looking forward to when hiring a landscaper.
This place must be heaven for those that are serious about their baking...  I'm quite an amateur, but was super impressed nonetheless with the amount of baking tools and supplies that are squeezed into this store.    The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  I went in with a grocery list from my sister-in-law.  I needed to get red chocolate to melt, red sprinkles, and white and black frosting in a tube.  Our plan was to make “Muno” pretzel rods (from Yo Gabba Gabba).  ABC had everything on my list and more... I ended up purchasing special candy “eyeballs” instead of the white and black frosting and they worked perfectly!  (They came out super cute by the way and were pretty easy to make too!)  I also bought some candles and a spatula.  I could have done a ton more damage; there were so many fun baking accessories there from cookie cutters and cake toppers to edible glitter frosting and special molds to make suckers, cake pops, chocolate, etc... they also carry really cute shaped pans, packaging, and more.   Whether you're a professional, or just an amateur looking to do a little baking of some sort, check this place out - they are locally owned and have been around since 1965.  They must be doing something right!  Additional tip: they offer all kinds of classes!
I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view, but the meal was high-quality (hands down the best macaroni and cheese on the planet). It was definitely one of the best dinners I've had at a wedding. They also did a great job of ushering everyone to the reception and the service was excellent.  Reason for 4 stars?  I wondered if the bride and groom were paying based on consumption because the drinks were incredibly stiff-overly so. I had to ask them to water mine down more than a few times.  Also, the top floor can accommodate several people but there are a few rooms rather than one large one so we missed out on the cake cutting because we were in the room with the band. For that reason I would prefer a location with one large space for a wedding reception, but over-all it was a very beautiful space.
Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally.  Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love BBQ.  No such luck.  Nothing seemed like real BBq  just over cooked and tasteless.  Very Chain resturant-y,  Cool memorabilia abut that's about it.  They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal.  I don't reccommend.
I don't live quiiiiite close enough for this to be MY neighborhood bar, but it meets all the requirements: laid-back atmosphere, great food, and seriouslygreatcraftbeerlist. Their beers are all of the cant-pick-up-at-the-gas-station variety and it's worth coming by just for that--the menu diversity is the cherry on top of my craft beer float.
My family and I have gone to this location several times and the wait has never been too long and the food has always been doggy bag worthy...
I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:  a) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this town  b) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouths  This place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid, over-battered and generally unpleasant. My dining partner's masaman curry was so sickly sweet it tasted like melted coconut ice cream. Surprisingly, the joint was slammed.   On the bright side, service was very fast. On the downside, our waitress was definitely stressed out and cranky possibly from waiting on the 14-top of inebriated co-eds across the room from us.  The takeaway: If you're from Pittsburgh, you'll probably love this place -- it was packed with your kinsmen when I was there. But if you've enjoyed quality thai food in any large coastal metropolis, steer clear.  p.s. food was needlessly pricey given the poor quality.
Arizona Science Center brings science and entertainment to the young and fresh minds of the community. The staff are always friendly! The weekend manager Manny is very knowledge and able about the ASC and all the exhibits. He was very helpful.  I look forward to visiting again. The weekends are always packed, if you can make it during the weekday you will bypass the mass of patrons.    R\\_
For an IHOP, the Pineville location is as good as it gets!  What do I mean “for an IHOP”?  It's a fast food franchise, whose claim to fame are their fast, and (fairly) inexpensive, breakfasts.  Frame your expectations accordingly, and you won't be disappointed.  We're especially fond of the night crew: (Spring, Tracy, and Tiffany); each are not only friendly and efficient, but they're funny as hell.  For as much as I might enter this location with a frown, I walk out with a smile each time, and it isn't the pancakes. It isn't that they're bad...it's just that they're standard IHOP fare.  The dining area is consistently clean; servers are great, the pancakes are pretty good, and fairly inexpensive.  This is a place for breakfast, but not much else.
Great service - very quick, definitely use the coupons - and the evaluation was honest and fair - and no pressure is applied - I would go back again
Great shop! Watched them make their waffle comes right in the shop and they are delish!  Tried the salted caramel and was surprised to find little chocolate covered caramels inside! Yum!
Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook “real” food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.  However, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers.   Now drop everything and order this curry!  And order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too.
Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a “give me 20 minutes” and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing.
Now that's what I call mediocre!  I'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all. I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.  So this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.  The couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.  Don't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...
We recently took our Mercedes to Virginia Auto Service for  a new set of tires. Since we purchased the vehicle there has been a vibration in the rear of the vehicle. We have taken it to several places, including the dealer, to have it repaired, to no avail. When Matt balanced the tires on his new machine, that simulated road force, the problem totally dissapeared. I guess it pays to go to the shops with the most high tech equipment. thanks guys!
Boring pretentious mall with old dated stores
I avoid this place!  They play extrememly loud music on Saturday nights till 2am. I will not go there until they change their practices.
Unlike many historic theaters across the country, the Harris Theater has been lovingly restored, and is actually a great place to watch a movie.  In a past life, it showed porno movies.  Now it screens eclectic art-house films and other smart selections programmed by PGH Filmmakers.  Located on Liberty Street downtown, the theater is easily accessible via public transportation.  The concessions are cheap, and the seats are comfy.  What more could you ask for?
There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese, lettuce, cucumber and a  chicken breast and it comes with a cup of Thai peanut sauce. Tasty indeed however, what a large mess this made! As we all know bagels aren't the easiest breads to bite. Smear on cream cheese add slick things like lettuce and cucumber and now you have a very messy meal. The cream cheese is of sort of like grease on a Bush Hog - everything wants to squirt out. No showers are in bathroom which is too bad as I needed one after eating my sandwich. With this said, the staff was very nice. I just need to avoid bagel sandwiches....
Great customer service at lunch. Order the lunch special and 6 other customers get served before me. Wait 45 minutes then get up to leave. Am asked “Do I want that to go?” Can anyone say @DirtyDrummer?
Harpers is good, when you just want to have a prime rib steak kind of night, with baked potato or sweet potato fries.   I came by here on a Thursday night, and they hosted a trivia night! It was fun!! Sadly, with my new work schedule, I have not had an opportunity to come back on any Thursdays.
This place was noted as a “must visit” location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say, it was definitely worth the visit.   To all reading this, be aware that essentially, this is just a grocery store we're talking about here. However, the rustic building, and kitchy offerings (like pour your own olive oil...or taste our 100cheeses) makes it kind of special.   When I was given this recommendation, I was told “head to the back to where the cheese is”. So, I did. WHOA - so much more cheese than I ever expected. But no macaroni and cheese....boo.   They should really consider serving mac and cheese.   That's all.
The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment. I have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead). We sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp. I had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables.
The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.  The one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.  The service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant.
My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.  I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.  My wife said, “No-we want our check only” and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.  This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back!    Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.   Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's.
And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly.   Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.  (And come on, I was WAAAYYYY overdue for a cut since I've been driving to Cleveland for a style.)  That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal. But, when I started to sign the charge slip, it said $65, not $55. “But,” I said, “the website said it was $55 for a Master stylist.” “Oh,” the chick at the counter said, “that's for Men's cuts.” Silly me.   So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, “Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.” What?????? So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. “Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.” Didn't she have my slip with the card number? “Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone.” “Or I can send you a gift certificate.” “Nope,” I said through clenched teeth, “I won't be coming back.”  It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, “Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.”   The search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!  P. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased.
First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though.   We were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably.  Our daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels.   The fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location.   Thunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.
I don't understand what all the hoopla is about. The food was lousy. The ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease. The sauce was weak. Overall, the food is overpriced. I've gone to this place twice and all I can say is I loved the beer!
Hubby and I love this place.  Good service, great food, OK prices (hence the 4 stars).  Have had the fondue appetizer twice here and it's awesome.  Get it on happy hour!  Dinner entree I had was a chicken dish with mashed potatoes - A-mazing.  I'm always a little hesitant to order chicken because it's often dried out, but this was moist and delicious.  Had a starter caesar salad which was “ok” - maybe had a little too much anchovy in the dressing for my liking?  Overall a terrific place, and we'll certainly be back.  Mondays they have happy hour 3pm to close!
We had planned on going to the Rhythm Room, which is directly across the street, but they were still charging a full cover at midnight, and just wanting to have a late-night cocktail, we took our hard-earned cash to Friends.  Just as we walked in, a drag show was ending, which was a treat.  Only wishing we had gotten there sooner, we sat down and ordered drinks.  I was amazed at the selection of flavored vodkas and other booze they have.  Not feeling too adventurous in that area I ordered a Ketel One Citroen on the rocks.  Generously poured, I don't remember the price, but I am sure it wasn't too steep.  As the night went on the place thinned out, and soon the wife and I were the only two people in the place.  The bartender, Anthony, was a joy to talk to.  We ended up just hanging with him until it was time to go.  I would go back just to have a bartender that good. Hell, the place is called Friends, and I'd be his friend any day. He was full of conversation and laughs.  At the end of the night, he called us a cab and made sure I didn't leave anything behind in my Ketel One haze.  He nearly had to come out to the parking lot to give me a record I left on the bar from a concert we attended earlier in the evening.  This place really is a comfortable and clean neighborhood bar that was welcoming to a random couple having a fun night on the town.  It was a great way to end a great night out.  Also, I would totally wear a friends T-shirt if they have them.  I love the logo.
Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight, you can rest your bottom on one of the dozens of white rocking chairs that line the atrium.  The rocking chairs are a nice perk and you should definitely try to take advantage of them if you can.  The only complaint I have are with the transport carts.  They are constantly beeping no matter what direction they're going.  I can understand the beeping while in reverse, but it's really annoying when it's constant.  Especially when you have 40 minutes to kill at the gate.  Thank goodness for the free WiFi...
Last year, our very active toddler (then 2-yrs-old) was diagnosed with a bone cyst in his femur. Our pediatrician gave us a list of orthopedic surgeons to consult and although Dr. Shindell was at the top of the list, we actually went to the second name -- one of the largest orthopedic groups in the valley -- first. When we met with that first surgeon, he said he could help our son but given the size and placement of the cyst and the risk of it breaking, he recommended that we go to someone who handles these type of cases more often. We asked who he would recommend if it were his son, and he said Dr. Shindell.  When we called Dr. Shindell's office, they were able to get us in for an appointment the next day. Needless to say, we were extremely anxious, but Dr. Shindell's calm demeanor and extensive experience helped us worry less. He explained all the options (including a brand new procedure that just finished clinical trials) and possible long-term effects. There was absolutely no pressure to take any one option over the others, and he was willing to give us the weekend to think over our options.  It took us about 20-minutes to decide what to do. Dr. Shindell immediately set up the surgery date and called Hanger Orthotics to squeezed us in for a fitting even though it was the end of day on a Friday.  The following week, our son had his surgery (would have been sooner, but we had to wait for his custom brace to be made). Dr. Shindell met us at the hospital to explain the details of the surgery ahead of time. After the surgery, he met us in the waiting room and explained the recovery plan and what to expect. Shindell again checked on our son the following day to see how he was recovering. Every time, he explained everything fully so that we could understand what was going on.  We still see Dr. Shindell regularly to check on the progress of our son's bone graft. Although he seemed very stoic when we first met him, we also have seen how much he personally cares about each patient... and their parents.  We are absolutely grateful for Dr. Shindell!
Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up, find out there is over an hour wait just to pee in a cup. Ask if there is any way I can just go because this whole procedure is going to take less the a minute to do. Ask to speak to a manager. David. Who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells I can either wait or leave. I explain I have been trying to call the location to set up a time were he basically tells me that there is nothing wrong with the phones he has been talking on them all day. But I have been here over 30 minutes now and have not heard the phone ring once. Overall the place is dirty. The wait is ridiculous especially for a basic drug screen and the staff is extremely rude. I highly suggest never ever coming here. I know I will never be back. Ever.
Summary:  Beautiful hotel, highly error-prone staff.   It is rare to find a hotel as beautiful as this. The look is very modern which I happen to love. It has a decent gym, which is also rare for a hotel. There is a very soothing bar area with live, gentle jazz music.  The staff are very professional in demeanor and friendly.  This COULD be an awesome place to stay.   I experienced the following over two stays:  I arrive 11pm, exhausted from travel, only to be told that the hotel is full.  The only room they have left to offer me is half a “parlor” room. I was given a SOFA BED to sleep on. I had made the reservation several weeks prior, with guaranteed late arrival.   I get to the room and the electronic key does not work. I call the front desk on my cell phone and wait in the hall 20 minutes half asleep for a guard to show up. His key does not work either.    Ok, this kind of thing happens sometimes at the best hotels, right?    I gave a shirt and slacks to laundry. That evening I receive someone else's underwear instead of my own clothes.   I gave a pair of jeans to dry clean, specifying not to wash because they would shrink. Well the jeans arrived that evening no longer my size.  A pattern develops.  On the third night, around 11pm a large heavy set man knocks at my door. He claims to be security but show no identification.  He wants to see my id.  Highly suspicious, I don't open the door and I slip my gym copy of my license under the door. Later he returns with police and insists I accompany them to the front desk. Later they apologize for the error.  What were they were thinking?  A waitress in the bar area ignores several requests for menu and a drink over a 20 minute period. The bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time.   A gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen.   The “weather report” button on the phone gives you a recording describing YESTERDAY's weather.  Etcetera.  Bottom Line:  Stay here for the serenity and beauty of the decor, but you will need the patience of a saint!
Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said “i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.” We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15, so we walked back in and were seated right away.    Food was ok--puttanesca tasted like yellow mustard but caprese was awesome.  We repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though.  I should mention that when we arrived a family with small children were leaving after finishing their meal and they had a stock-pile of high chairs in plain view, so it was not unreasonable to bring our well-behaved girls (6 and 2 yrs old).  By 6:30, there were still a number of empty tables.  If you're not from Pittsburgh, there attending college or joining your college-aged child or have small children, I would avoid this place.
I like CLT.  This airport is large and has a lot of people going through it, and there are many places to stop in, grab lunch or dinner, and get to your next stop.  I normally don't have much time to hang out here, but I have been to a couple restaurants and they were clean and fast.  I especially like the fact this airport has six Starbucks locations.  If you are flying FROM Charlotte, try the A concourse TSA line, it is usually shorter.
I went to a Bob Marley laser show as a 'favor' for my husband...  the lasers were really cool.  I would not recommend them if you are prone to migraines, or have a neuro disorder, such as seizures. I think if the music was more my taste, it would have been awesome.
I have tasted the best pizza in the US, Pepe's New Haven, CT and I have tasted a whole bunch of bad pizza and a whole bunch in the middle.  I am coming to the conclusion that pizza is a very personal thing to people who love it like I do.  After years of people telling me to go here, we finally stopped on our way home from my son's hockey game at noon on Saturday.  Service was okay after we asked the people sitting next to us what we needed to do.  No one spoke up to tell us to come to the counter and order.  But after we figured it out everything was good.  We ordered a large pie, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 cheese and sausage.  The crust is very good and some of the best tasting I have had in some time.  It actually had a taste to it not just a bread taste.  After that, everything else is what I consider the personal taste part.  The sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me.  I don't know if they used provolone I should have asked but it gave the pizza a funny taste to me.  I won't be going back, just because my personal taste.
I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.
When I first moved to Phoenix, I was walking around the Esplanade and saw this place.  I had lived in NYC for years and had lived on Mercer street where there was a “Merc Bar” so thought I would go in and see if there was any connection.  Sure enough, this place is the 2nd location of the NYC Merc Bar.  Since I live across the street I come here fairly regularly.  I'm usually a wine or beer drinker and my only critique would be the limited selection of draft beers and very small wine list.  To their credit, their three beer tap usually has both Stella and Guinness, two of my favorites.  Nonetheless, I still have not found a wine there that I really love.  Not many people realize that they do make some excellent cheese plates if you need to snack on something.  And the bar always has both goldfish and pretzels.  If you are on a date, the really great thing is that you can grab a cozy table in the back and talk if you don't want to deal with the bar scene.
It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.   I'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps.
I went into this location and had a coupon for a buy one foot long sub get the second one for 99 cents well my total ended up being $15.76, sounds a  bit high, well my preparer Hector “Clerk 21” did not how to use the register and called another employee to ring in my coupon, which they did not apply obviously since my bill was almost $16.00 and they were cursing and were rude and were complaining about how they did not have time to mess around because they had a party platter order they had to prepare. Very disappointing, maybe Subway should invest in better training or maybe higher wages to get better staff.
I really wanted to like this place. I live nearby and I love the Downtown area. I want all the places here to be 4-5 star joints. But my partner and I showed up on a Sunday afternoon, with only a half-dozen people in the place and just as many waitresses, and they still took 45 minutes to deliver our food. We watched our waitress eat her lunch at the bar. And then when our food came it wasn't right.  We ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey. One bite, however, and we knew our bread was more than day-old. I actually had to ask them if it was toasted (it wasn't) because it was just as hard and dry as a piece of toasted bread. Back it went.  The pizza which I ordered because of the Kalamata Olives (their “Mediteranean”) was missing Kalamata Olives. That's right -- it's the major ingredient on the pie and the joker in the kitchen forgot to put them on.   Never mind, after 45 minutes you'll eat anything. Beer was overpriced at $5 for a glass. We got out of there as quickly as we could after the food was consumed. Won't be back.
Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?
Horrible customer service. Unless you are into horror movies or The Simpsons the people working the counter can't give you a honest review. However they will make fun of your movie selections and treat you like crap. Can't wait to go back!!
love it.  i have been comming here with the rents since i was little, so its nostolgic for me.  i still get the same thing, a scoop of lemon on top of a scoop of chocolate in a waffle cone.
I wont be back here again,  Ever.    Can one give less that 1 star?   It is a bummer as I used to frequent this place as it is conveniently located for me.  Pamela the bartender is a sweetheart and works hard to recognize people by name.   Personalized service like hers helped me to overlook issues like the significant cleanliness challenges that are easy to spot if you look around.   If you think I am joking go into the bar and look up a the light fixtures.   That fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust.  Carpets are dingy and smells like old beer.  This place rocks as a nightclub on weekends I dont think that cleanliness is the priority......anyhow....I spent a lot of money there over the years, mainly for lunch or after work cocktails with friends.  Never more..... not because of the issues outlined above, but it is beacuse how I was treated when visiting the establishment not long ago.   Pamela was not working that day (sadly) and the male bartender decided that he was more interested in lecturing me on his beliefs than he was in serving my drinks and taking my money.  He had an issue, and apparently I was the target and cause of his rantings.   He was sad about the lack of customers and decided it was my fault as I mentioned I worked downtown.   His rants about downtown businesses was unorthodox and uncalled for.   I drank my beer and hurried out reminding myself never to set foot in the place again.  No wonder they are lacking for customers.    There are more and more restaurants downtown.  Time to step it up or get out of the way Matador!
Good food. Friendly staff. Good prices.  I love the Chicken and Broc.  Generals Chicken is good but not great. This is a staple in my diet since I live so close!!
I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion), but this one holds a special place for me. I'd just driven into Phoenix on a Wednesday afternoon, after a long drive across the country. Earlier in the day I'd signed the lease on my apartment and confirmed with the movers when they were coming the next morning.   So this tired chick hopped on Yelp to find some food -- nearby, familiar, and good enough. I found this Applebee's not too far away and also in the same parking lot as Target (killing two birds with one stone). It was my first meal here, since all of my belongings (read: pots, pans, cooking utensils) were on an 18-wheeler somewhere in the vast Phoenix metropolis. The people here were friendly enough, and I like their “550” menu of dishes fewer than 550 calories.   So while I've grown fond of finding and frequenting locally-owned joints, on occasion I do hit a chain. This one was there for a very tired chick who needed some hot food and a nearby Target!
I enjoyed every dish I have had there. I'm a huge fan of their General Tso's chicken and egg drop soup. They have some amazing dishes, and they pile your plates with food.
Been desperately (desperately!) searching for a ramen place in Phx after discovering the deliciousness that is ramen in San Diego, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by the “Noodles” sign on my way to a hair appointment down the street at Shampoo Ink.  Made a mental note to stop in afterwards for lunch. I am SO glad I did!  Service was stellar - really some of the best service I've had in a LONG time.  Super friendly and attentive.  The ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.  No veggies like the place I love in Oceanside, CA, but still, the flavor was there and it was awesome.  This will be my new lunch place EVERY time I get my hair done.
Only two stars due to the lack of selection.  No food menu and inside is like a dungeon.  They do have a nice outside area with TVs and a rather secluded environment.  One of these stars is because of their Sunday special.  $4 Car Bomb shots!!  Other than that, they really don't have any other specials.  I asked the bartender why that was?? His response, “we don't want to attract that kind of crowd.”  What crowd would that be, sir?? hmmmmm.. Pass on this place.    -Ian M.
I've been here only once for lunch and I was really pleased.  I think the Bento Box is the best value, perfect for a quick lunch.  The decor is really surprisingly authentic to a neighborhood ramen-ya in Japan.  The staff were very nice.  I took a little tart with me as a treat for later, loved it, and wished I'd gotten more.  I'm definitely going back again.
One of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas.  With that said the owner took our order and she was rude not friendly at all..... 1. She get the order wrong 2. She food was kind of cold 3. Seen like she didn't want to be there (she is the owner) found out she was the when I was paying the bill 4. She was trying to over charge the bill postings images of bill.   5. She never told us about the drinks weren't free refills  6. Got mad when I pointed out that the bill was added wrong  7. Slam the bill on the table when she corrected it. Even my girlfriend who is calm was shocked 8. When the bill the guy owner said sorry for the bad service When noticed I not happy
Overpriced, salty and overrated!!! Why this place is so popular I will never understand.
Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i've found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle, they are shipped to Pittsburgh, old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.  they also run the inclines, which are pretty cool if not old.
Although the staff was friendly and the language was not a barrier for me as it was for others, the food I got was not very good. After I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, the woman turned on the fryer and, without waiting for the oil to heat up, she put in the chicken and my crab rangoon. Therefore, when I ate the food it wasn't crispy as a good General Tso's/crab rangoon  should be. Another thing that I noticed was that the chicken that she put in the fryer was sitting on the counter in the heat. *note: she hadn't fried any in quite some time which is why she had to turn the fryer on. The person that said the food was too sweet was right. Even though the menu said *spicy for my meal, there was no “zip” at all. Take it for what it's worth, but I know I will be looking for another restaurant to get my take out from now on.
La Tolteca is the most authentic mexican food. It is so good and a great place to eat if you are down town. Check out the grocery section, they have freshly made tortillas to take home. Delicious!
I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.  Normally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.  I recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it.
Yes it is a chain but some chains are good!  The only reason I didn't give the Palm five stars is because YOU NEED A 6 OZ STEAK.  Us chicks can't handle 9 ounces!!!    I love the fillet - I get it with the Oscar option and I can't talk or think about anything else while I am eating it.  Perfectly cooked (I like medium-rare), perfectly seasoned (slightly salty!!), perfectly served in a little bit of au jus.  I had happy dreams for days....sigh....    The app we got was the bacon-wrapped scallops - perfectly cooked and served on a bed of spinach.  Just fantastic.  I love the old school bread sticks in the wrapper.  Such a perfect way to shovel the Palm butter into my pie-hole.    Service is excellent - fast and knowledgeable about every dish and historic artifact about the Palm.  Love it!  This location valet's which I recommend because you will need someone to roll you out after you have eaten every last drop!  Can't wait for the next special occasion!!!!   :-D
DO NOT GO HERE! Had my oil changed on 12/2/14. As I left the lot I pulled out onto University Ave and my car immediately died. I turned around and headed back to Jiffy Lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change. They took my car and “said” they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad. They immediately said “we have a guy, would you like us to call him?” I felt like I was being scammed, how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change I now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery? I declined their offer to “call their guy” and decided to take the chance and drive home.   Once home, i took my car to my local garage, which I should have done in the first place, and they informed me that Jiffy Lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil. Considering all Jiffy Lube does is change oil, I feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep. So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having “their guy” fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg. Shame on you Jiffy Lube! Just remember, someone is more likely to share a bad customer service experience than a good one, you can bet I will be sharing this bad one!
This place is under new management and is much improved. Huge crowds, but fast takeaway service.
Unfortunately the reason why this place  has gone down hill is because it's no longer what it used to be.
Food is consistently good. We often go for weekend brunch. I'm from NJ, which has a lot of 24 hour diners. This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day, so it's great in my book. Don't come if you mind long lines or kids; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts!
Overall felt like the food lacked flavor. The jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us. The BBQ shrimp and cornbread were both good.
This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.
After two recent visits here, I can honestly say I am torn on my review, but overall I know I have had better. Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa??? On to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning! As for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills, never saw her, except our order and bill, and very blah!  Not sure we would return anytime soon.
To quote ESPN... “c'mon man!”  How about putting a decent product on the floor.  And where is Michael Jordan?  Does he attend games?  The night we went they were playing the Celtics.  BTW, we are BIG Celtics fans.  It reminded me of seeing a Red Sox game in Camden Yards.  In other words, felt like a home game for Boston.  As in most sporting arenas, the concessions are RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED.  Two sodas that you would pay $2 - $3 for at a fast food place cost $12.  I also ordered a Jerk Chicken Sandwich.  Did it come straight from the refrigerator?  Cold cold cold.  Back to the concessions, why do we... the Joe Q. Publics of the world put up with that?  Next time, I'm eating before and will visit the local water fountain for a drink!  At the end of the game, I went to meet a fellow “Yelper” and we were chatting for no more than 2-3 minutes when an usher came along and said we needed to vacate.  Thanks for coming... now get the *&^%$( out!  Haha.  He was very pleasant about it.  Well, no more Celtics visits until next season.  See you then.
newly remodeled. lots of parking! Also known as county.
We loved our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved into the area and found this place and fell in love with it.  The inside of the restaurant is beautiful and really clean. The staff are all really nice and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us since we live a few blocks away.  I thought the food was great. We've tried a few different meals. My wife does not enjoy very spicy food and the mild versions suit her fine. I do like my food spicy and if I had one complaint it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced so far. The food has great flavors and think it is spot on.
NOTE:  I only just got my car back so I cannot yet comment on the long-term resilience of the paint job.  My wife bought a new VW Passat in December and was hit by a dump truck in January. There was body damage to the driver-side front door, back door and rear quarter panel. Our insurance is with Geico who has an agent that works right out of ABRA's office. So I took it there for an assessment.  Everyone was extremely kind and helpful. The process of getting the estimate both by Geico and by ABRA was very quick and easy. Also, ABRA was nice enough to provide me with a rental car on their dime. Enterprise came out to ABRA's location and we took care of the rental there.  All I paid for was the insurance which was like $12-13/day.  ABRA sent daily updates via text message letting me know their progress and as soon as they had an estimated completion time, the let me know that as well.  I dropped it off on Tuesday, January 21 and they completed all the repairs and paint on Friday however I couldn't pick it up until Monday, January 27 as the paint needed to dry.  The car looks excellent!
Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. ;) The only thing that is upsetting is that once you fall in love with something on the menu, it always gets taken off. I have had probably 3 or 4 dishes that I have loved over the years that are just no longer available.
I live across the street and visit often. Could not ask for a better atmosphere with a view of the inside of Chase Field! The customer service has always been great. Often times it get dinner to go and the bartenders are friendly and chat it up while I wait. Just the traditional Fridays menu but the location makes it worth going. Definite place to check out when you are downtown. Doesn't have to be a game day.
Brought my Saturn to Fairfield Automotive and I couldn't be happier. The fuel pump had a component that was cracked and they were able to repair it, rather than my purchasing the entire unit, which saved me the equivalent of my mortgage this month.  I will definitely return and would recommend their service. Very personable and friendly staff, and an overall great experience.
Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper!   Place - two stories and for the most part, clean.  Price - it's Mickey D's.   Service - somewhat quick in the drive-thru, friendly people. They only forgot once, but it's forgivable.
I love this place but very disappointed they took their best sandwich, the pizza grinder, off the menu.  I guess I won't be going here as much now.
Although this running store is not in the most convenient location for us, my husband and I would drive across town to get fitted for running shoes. We tried a few other places for fittings, but this place seemed to do the best job and have employees with the most expertise.   When I first decided to try running, I went to a bigger store and ended up with shoes that were way too tight and just not a good fit. A few months later, I tried this place and was really pleased with how thorough they were. Your first running shoe fitting can be a little awkward (I don't really like people around my feet anyway), but they made it very comfortable and easy and I loved the shoes they recommended. I probably paid more than other more discounted places, but I would rather pay a little more for good foot health and a better running experience.  Overall, a great place to be fitted for running shoes whether you're just starting out or have been running for a long time.
Really, you guys think chips should be the basis of a good or bad rating????? wow how about the actual food, the real meal, not the free stuff in front of you to nibble while you are waiting. Juan's has awesome food, nothing I haven't liked yet, red, green, chicken, carne asada. you name it mmmm good. Old school eating without all the bells and whistles. They don't load the plate with a pound of cheese and a half a pound of garnish like some places (carlos O) does. Nor do they just do 1 thing great and forget the rest- it's all great. And then you have other places that grill meat or do something fancy with fish/chicken or meat and slop half cooked rice and garbage beans on your plate. This is good home grown mexican food! Great family that has made an awesome business themselves. Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time, great neighborhood place too, that's why you see them do so many take out orders.
Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.
I love this location for Fed Ex. They were a life saver for me over the Christmas holidays. They are always cheerful and friendly when you come in. Even though when  they say hello many people do not respond. Rude people!!  Any way, the service is excellent it always gets there when they say it will. They are super quick when they help you and they will even package it up for you.  There are some really wonderful people working in the shipping dept. Chris being one of them. A truly nice person who really wants to help you as best as he can. If only more of us took pride in our job like that.  Great location, fast service, delivered when promised...what more could you ask for.
Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.    There's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.  Since we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.    Sound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations.   I have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the “nightmare” worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!  Bravo!
This is our neighborhood spot for ceviche... though if you want oysters go to the spot at McDowell and 18th St... no idea what the name is.
Came here for afternoon tea with friends.  If you are going to splurge on the tea, you might as well pay the extra 15 dollars for unlimited sparking wine.  Geoffrey the tea sommelier will refill it as much as he refills the tea.  My favorite tea by far was his blend of coconut jasmine.  Absolutely heavenly.  I was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but by the time the dessert course rolls around, you will be plenty full.  The scones are the best, they are served with clotted cream, raspberry jam and lemon curd.  Simply decadent and heavenly.  The piano player adds a nice touch.  A nice change of pace from the original field trip.  You are paying a bit (there is an extra “tea service” charge on top of gratuity and tax, but well worth it.
First and last to this club. Very pricy,poor service and no contact dance. ... Other clubs in charlotte are better ... Very disappointed .....
Can I give this 0 Stars? I guess not. Bottom line, there are no vegetarian options, the produce is really bad, the line was ridiculously long because there was only one cashier in the entire store. I am so disappointed in this Safeway and will not return.
We went to Scottsdale area for spring break last week, so I looked up restaurants on my “Flavortown” app, that show where Guy has reviewed (Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives).  Found this and told hubby we had to try it out one night.  We got there at about 5:45 or so on a Monday or Tuesday night - figuring no wait. We were wrong. It was already full (small, only maybe 10-12 tables inside), so put name on the list.  We waited maybe 20 minutes or so.  Worth the wait.  I got the pasta bolognese that they showed on the show. Delicious sauce with fresh, tender pasta.  Hubby and son got the chicken parm, their usual.  I was hoping hubby would try to osso buco so I could try that too, but oh well.  Daughter had fettucini alfredo. They liked their meals too.  They DO serve wine here now - so that must have changed since some of the past reviewers said it was BYOB.  We also had their fresh, homeade pink lemonade. LOVED it. Wow - fresh with some type of herb in it that was so good.  Glad we made the trip here after the afternoon spring training baseball game. A bit pricy I guess - for 4 of us, with just one glass of wine, I think we made it out for just under $90.  Friendly staff and it's a well-oiled machine. They'll take good care of you.
Stayed here for a long weekend for a friend's wedding in Mesa. Driving from Southern California, it was located conveniently near the freeway and parking was easy! Check in was a breeze, the receptionist was very friendly- he gave us two warm cookies and a map of the surrounding area to help us out. Looks a bit outdated from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover- the rooms are definitely kept up very nicely! The room was so spacious! Upon entering, there is a couch that turns into a bed, with a desk that was convenient when we ordered pizza and ate around it. There is a microwave, large fridge and everything was so clean! The separate room was nice, with a king bed that was large and comfy and had nice closet space to hang our clothes for the wedding. We went to the Belvedere restaurant downstairs on the first night to grab some drinks and the drinks were very overpriced but I guess that's expected for a hotel bar. We loved everything about the hotel, especially the complimentary breakfast located in the restaurant. Buffett style, with a different main entree that differed everyday (like french toast, pancakes, and waffles) with sausage, bacon, yogurt, pastries and coffee! Would definitely recommend staying here and will plan on returning to this hotel once baseball spring training comes around for my Dodgers!
I live about 5 minutes from Belmont, thus I do most of my shopping there as opposed to heading into the city itself (and lets face it, going down Wilkinson toward uptown isn't exactly the best place to shop!).  I mix up my groceries between Harris Teeter, Walmart, and Bi-Lo.  This Bi-Lo in particular usually has a lot of helpful folks, it's very conveniently located and is open all the time.  I prefer the deli here over Walmart lets say and you can usually get a lot of items on sale that are cheaper than Walmart as well - but not a lot of the stuff that isn't on sale.  If you are looking for a grocery store in and around Belmont, this is probably the best place to go.
We love this place.  It's close to home and never disappoints.  I can honestly say, that I've never eaten anything I don't like.  It's always a sure thing.
I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable, which is nice for couples and families.  But with each experience, I am less impressed. The food is good. However, there are better places to dine within the Southpark area. The food is moderately priced, but is too much for what you get. My last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu. The offerings are scarce for a restaurant with a nonspecific specialty. I'm not big on chain restaurants, but I would have been happier visiting The Cheesecake Factory located across the street from Harper's which has many more menu options.  I am sad to say that I will not visit again unless an executive group decision is made to dine here.  : /
We had to stop by the Apple store to replace my phone so we decided to head to CPK for lunch. It's been quite sometime since my boyfriend and I both had been to one so it sounded like a good idea.  We got seated right away as it was just lunch time on a Sunday and it wasn't to busy. We were instantly helped and our server took our drink orders. He also asked if we wanted bread and oli which we declined (as we knew we'd be eating enough carbs). He promptly brought us our drinks and what I loved about it I ordered a flavored ice tea to which he suggested me trying before adding any sweetener in it as they use syrup to make the flavors. It was perfect as is. My boyfriend ordered a pepperoni pizza and the waiter wanted to make sure he was okay with the oregano and spicy pepperoni they now use (which he was), I had the chicken tequila fettuccine w/extra cilantro. As he was putting in the order he turned to just confirm I wanted extra cilantro which I did.   The manager brought our food over in less than 10 minutes and it was perfect! About 1/4 of the way down on my ice tea our server brought me another one.   The server asked if we wanted any desert which we were stuffed anyways. My boyfriend and I both said this was one of the best service we had received from any restaurant in a long time. As we left my boyfriend mad a point to tell the manager how great the service was.
If you have a Mercedes, you need to take it here! Being new in the area, I wasn't sure who to trust. I made the mistake of taking it to the dealer for an oil change and came out with a $300 bill. Seriously? It's oil and a filter.   I tried this shop and found the owner worked at the dealership for 20 years before opening his own shop. Wow, nice people, and great service. He fixed what I needed and recommended a few things (the same things Firestore mentioned when I took it there for new tires and brakes, so I knew it wasn't an up sell.) I called around and M B Motors still had the lowest price. M B Motors fixed my car in a timely manner and showed me everything they did.   Their hours are early in the day 6:30 - 3:30 so it's convenient to drop off before work, but a little difficult to pick up. Nothing that would effect me taking my car there. Who wants to work on hot cars when it's 110 degrees out!  I feel much better now that I have a place to take my Benz, especially being a single female and not knowing much about cars or what to do.
Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.
Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long.
A new friend suggested I check out Rebecca Lynn Studio; he is balding, and said “if they can make me look good, imagine what they can do for you!”  So I popped in one day for a cut--literally called em up and drove right on over, no wait!    The place is clean and cute, and they have wet stations which means you don't have to traipse back and forth across the salon for a wash, they just spin you around and viola!    Dan cut my hair, and he was friendly and personable.  He really asked me how I liked my hair cut, what tools to use, etc., since I know “my hair best.”  My hair can be a little difficult to work with, so I really appreciate that he took the time to ask.  Another great bonus: 1 week guarantee on the cut.  If I didn't like it, I could come back for a redo or even get my money back.  Got the cut on Monday and was back on Friday for some tweaking, which I'm glad I did, but even better to know the offer was there.    $23 for a haircut is a wonderful deal, but beware: CASH ONLY!  They also do styling, hair color, perms, nails, waxing and make up.  They are an Aveda salon (but not a concept salon).  I haven't decided yet to keep seeing Dan, or back to Robyn at Cha Cha, but I would recommend Rebecca Lynn Studio to anyone looking for a great deal on great service.  As of 4/13 they were going to be closed for 10 days to remodel, so be sure and call ahead.
This place is known for their chicken fried steak.  And they certainly do it right.  They have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of chicken fried steak they have served....now that's confidence in your product!  But if you feel like something else, they have an amazing prime rib (you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out, they run out).  If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.  You won't regret it.  It's amazing!!    Don't expect some fancy schmancy steakhouse--but go hungry and you won't regret your decision to go there!
I went to phoenix skin in August 2013 to discuss about laser resurfacing. The doctor who I had met on that day had no idea about laser skin resurfacing and she gave me details about Blanca Fergoso, surgical coordinator  in phoenix skin care. I tried to schedule an appointment with her but when ever I tried to call her all the time it went to voicemail and even called the help desk to schedule an appointment with her but of no help.  I went to phoenix skin after lot of research and good reviews but of no use. If they won't care about their patients why would I recommend phoenix skin care please avoid Phoenix skin care.
A year later, prices have increased 70% and the quality of food have declined. Customer service is still superb though. Today, I ordered a pad-see-yew with beef level 5 - was made in an old pan with burnt scraps, 25% beef in dish only, there were clumps of chili not blended in the dish, and was drenched in oil. Another dish, red curry with chicken, was always lacking chicken pieces, they've increased prices and cut back on portions and quality, which happens quite often to good restaurants gone bad. Sad to say, this used to be my favorite place, but now we will never return and we are currently looking for another Thai place to be our go-to.

The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich.   Redfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for.
Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.  We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!  Perfect.   My mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!  And it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.  Talk about false advertisement...
Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!
Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime, you can find some 'trinkets' for cheap on the inside.    This K-Mart has some affordable home furninishing knock-offs (by cheap, I mean cheaper than Target/IKEA).  While it some of it is dated, K-Mart still carries the much-touted Martha Stewart brands.  I've found a 'runner' rug and bedspread that both look like something from department stores.  The same can be said for the furniture, so don't hate on my stylish house.   The clothing department is slightly dicier, but I have scavenged some faddish clothes (think Gap 3 years ago) among the Big Bubba t-shirts and overalls.  Their young men's section has good deals at the end of the season, like utility shirts or those really metrosexual boot-cut jeans for less than $15.  Yeah....really.  The rest of the store is pretty much filler.  If you actually go to this K-Mart ( or any K-Mart) looking for a decent selection of sporting goods/shoes/electronics, you will likely pay more than other big box retailers or be appalled by the selection.  If you're like me and approach K-Mart shopping like thrift store diving, you will be pleasantly surprised. Can't decide then if visiting K-Mart is frugal or frivolous, but who doesn't need another cheap belt?
I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs, other than those that I BBQ myself. Everyone pointed me to Honey Bear's BBQ.  The place is clean and casual, and the service is OK. But the ribs were horrible. The beer was fantastic though and I first thought maybe the alcohol had dulled my taste buds. I remember screaming, “Either this is a poor cut of beef/pork or both animals had mad cow/pig disease!”  I decided to return and give them another chance, and not order alcohol. I ordered the ribs and again, “Mad Cow Disease!”  I won't ever return. How does that go: “First time shame on you, second time shame on me...”
I got a groupon for Dean of Shadyside for hairline highlights, deep conditioning masque, and a hair cut for $35.  I had never been, but I gave it a try.  The groupon was for a level 1 stylist, and I had Erika.  She was pretty great!  I've never had highlights before, and she helped me figure out what would look good.  My highlights look great, the cut looks great, she did exactly what I wanted her to do!  I never make hair appointments far in advance, but I pre-booked my next appointment!!!  I would highly recommend this place, and I recommend Erika as well!
Been here a few times. It's a strange mix of foods (sushi, ramen, and Italian?!) with the ambiance more like a French cafe, but it somehow works. Their pad thai is tasty and I love the udon. The portions are quite large and they don't skimp on protein. Staff is all very friendly and it doesn't break the bank. I want to come back and try the ramen, the table across from me demolished theirs so it must be good.
Ok, but they do not go out of their way to help! I didn't have a credit card so at first they said I couldn't check in. Finally they allowed me to put down cash. Then I went to breakfast, and the shuttle refused to pick us up because “roads were too bad” We waited for 45 minutes at the restaurant. No cabs could pick us up, so I called the hotel and explained our situation (had to get to work soon, 5 mth pregnant woman with me, only a mile and a half away). He said he couldn't help. We had to walk while the snow blew in our faces. When we were almost there, we saw the shuttle pull out with the smoking shuttle driver in it, driving in the opposite direction, away from us. I cannot believe how rude they were
If your're looking for a country breakfast, this is the place!  Eggs the way you like them. They serve up a great cup of coffee and an excellent country breakfast. They serve breakfast till 11am.  They have a good lunch menu too. The Greek salad is one of the best I've ever had. Burgers, Cheese Steaks and sandwiches.  They also have real good sweet tea! Serving since 1957.
I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10.   After reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away.
When I went in it smelled overpoweringly like barf. Remembrance of the stomach bile stink still haunts me whenever I think of or pass by this eyesore. It was so strong I couldn't talk, listen or even think. I could hardly choke down the swill and nod to whatever crap music was playing or in rough acknowledgment of what I thought someone else was saying. WHAT DID SHE SAY? THIS PLAY DUCKLING BUCKS? Its pretty loud.   Needless to say it was also too crowded, dark and dirty. I realize that I am not exactly in their target market, being over 21 and all, but this place is just horrifically bad. Those that characterize this bar as anything but an unmitigated crap-dungeon are either lying to themselves or have never been to a decent bar.
We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?
We showed up after a Pirates game to keep the buzz rolling, and this place did the trick. 22-ounce Yuenglings for $4? My kind of place. There were plenty of sports on the tellie, some really kickin' alt rock music, and one of the friendliest crowds of all time. That adds up to a hell of a bar in my book.
